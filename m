No, just tv_granularity. Most users won't need to care that this
is not a regular timespec then.

Yes, for example rsync could use this to determine wether a local (e.g. FAT)
and a remote (e.g. NFS) file are identical or not. Right now, you can pass
the granularity in seconds as a command line argument, but it would be nice
to have rsync do this automatically if possible.

right.

either way works fine for me.

There are also two extra bits in tv_nsec ;-). No, I don't think we
need picoseconds any time soon.

One byte padding might not be the worst thing to have in here, like

        struct xstat_time {
                signed long long        tv_sec;         /* seconds */
                unsigned int            tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
                unsigned short          tv_gran_mant;   /* mantissa */
                signed char             tv_gran_exp;    /* exponent */
                unsigned char           unused;
        };
