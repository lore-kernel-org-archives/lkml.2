Ho-hum...  What happens if the same fs is mounted twice on server?  I.e.
have ext2 from /dev/sda1 mounted on /a and /b on server, then on the client
do mount -t nfs foo:/a /tmp/a; mount -t nfs foo:/b /tmp/b.  Which path
would we get from GETATTR with fs_locations requested, if we do it for
/tmp/a/x and /tmp/b/x resp.?  Dentry will be the same, since fsid would
match.

Or would the server refuse to export things that way?
