This may not be helpful but if you export the filesystem with the
"subtree_check" option then the NFS server will always know a name for any
file that it modifies.

This is not without cost though, which is why it is no longer the default.

If the client opens a file, the server moves it to a new directory and then
the server cache is flushed, then the client will get an ESTALE error.  This
is rarely a problem in practice but when it is it can be quite annoying...
