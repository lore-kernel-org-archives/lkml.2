I am proposing treating /proc/sys like /proc/net is currently treated.

Assuming the process in question is not in the pid namespace available
to proc then yes you will indeed have a broken link.  But a broken
link is only a problem for new applications that are doing something strange.

I am proposing treating /proc/sys like /proc/net has already been
treated.  Aka move have the version of /proc/sys that relative to a
process be visible at: /proc/<pid>/sys, and with a compat symlink 
from /proc/sys -> /proc/self/sys.

Just like has already been done with /proc/net.

Semantically this should be easy to understand, and about as backwards
compatible as it gets.
