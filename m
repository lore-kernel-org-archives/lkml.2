Matt and Jon,

If you'd be up to it: could you try testing your dm-crypt+ext4
corruption reproducers against the following two 2.6.37-rc commits:

1) 1de3e3df917459422cb2aecac440febc8879d410
then
2) bd2d0210cf22f2bd0cef72eb97cf94fc7d31d8cc

Then, depending on results of no corruption for those commits, bonus
points for testing the same commits but with Andi and Milan's latest
dm-crypt cpu scalability patch applied too:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/365542/

Thanks!
Mike
