So I can summarise where I think we are in these discussions:

We provide the ability to give all kernel devices a "preferred name".
By default this will be the device name the kernel would have originally
assigned.  the dev_printk's will use the preferred name, and it will be
modifiable from user space.  All the kernel will do is print out
whatever it is ... no guarantees of uniqueness or specific format will
be made.  Since we're only providing one preferred_name file, the kernel
can only have one preferred name for a device at any given time
(although it is modifiable on the fly as many times as the user
chooses).

The design is to use this preferred name to implement what Hitachi wants
in terms of persistent name, but we don't really care.

All userspace naming will be taken care of by the usual udev rules, so
for disks, something like /dev/disk/by-preferred/<fred> which would be
the usual symbolic link.

This will ensure that kernel output and udev input are consistent.  It
will still require that user space utilities which derive a name for a
device will need modifying to print out the preferred name.
