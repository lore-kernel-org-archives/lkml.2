This doesn't look like the best solution, because it involves adding a 
nontrivial routine (pm_runtime_autosuspend) to a hot path.

How about this instead?  When blk_pre_runtime_suspend returns -EBUSY,
have it do a mark-last-busy.  Then rpm_suspend will automatically
reschedule the autosuspend for later.

I think you still need to have that check.  After all, the block layer 
has other users besides the SCSI stack, and those users don't call 
blk_pm_runtime_init.

If you make the change that I recommended above then this is still 
necessary.
