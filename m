Hello, again.

Adding Shaohua Li as he fixed a similar issue in 4a0b75c7d0 "block,
cfq: fix empty queue crash caused by request merge".  The original
thread can be read from

That should have been service tree.  I couldn't find more missing
removals other than the one Shaohua's patch already fixed.  Close
cooperator selection in cfq_select_queue() seems suspicious tho.  I
can't see what prevents it from returning an empty coopeator cfqq.
I'm trying to verify whether that's the case.  Will update when I know
more.

Thanks.
