I beg to differ. ctime is not completely useless. It reflects changes on 
the inode for when you don't you change the content. It's like an mtime 
for the metadata. It comes useful when you go around in your filesystem 
trying to figure out who of your co-admins screwed up the permissions on 
/etc/passwd... and if the mtime is the same as that of the last backup, 
I can at least have a reasonable assurance that it was /only/ the 
metadata that was tampered with. (SHA1 check, yeah yeah, costly on large 
files.)
