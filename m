I'd like to know those patches are on what state. Waiting in writeback
page makes slower, like you mentioned it (I guess it would more
noticeable if device was slower that like FAT uses). And I think
currently it doesn't help anything others for blk-integrity stuff
(without other technic, it doesn't help FS consistency)?

So, why is this locking stuff enabled always? I think it would be better
to enable only if blk-integrity stuff was enabled.

If it was more sophisticate but more complex stuff (e.g. use
copy-on-write technic for it), I would agree always enable though.

Thanks.
