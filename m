In short:
=2E........
Problem solving at its root is more efficient than at =E2=80=9Cend of pipe=
=E2=80=9D.



IMHO this is an example of =E2=80=9Cend of pipe=E2=80=9C thinking with foll=
owing downsides:
=2E........................................................................=
=2E.
*  Maintainers point of view:
   *  Introduces new problems:  Breaking holes in the access restrictions
      provided by the Linux kernel at will of unprivileged users would rend=
er
      the kernel unusable for reliable operation in multiuser environments.
   *  Adds code complexity and risk of bugs.
   *  Adds future maintainance load.
*  Users point of view:
   *  Editing /etc/fstab or using mount commands with options not in
      /etc/fstab require root privileges anyway, at least on sane systems.
   *  Adds usage complexity (new vs. old files, on disk vs. pretended UIDs =
=E2=80=A6).
   *  Adds risk of usage errors.



IMHO the =E2=80=9Cright thing to do=E2=80=9D is to solve the problem at its=
 root:
=2E................................................................
My habit is, whenever I use {group,user}add commands:
*  In advance I create a list of all current and future users (user, GID, U=
ID)
   common to all systems that might exchange files.  The list is designed to
   have =E2=80=9Cheadroom=E2=80=9D for future additions.
*  I always consult this list and use options --gid $userGID --uid $userUID=
 to
   {group,user}add commands.
*  Exchanging files with an unforeseen system is an exception, which requir=
es
   root privileges anyway,

Advantages:
*  Decent migration of files to other systems via backups, external storage=
 =E2=80=A6
*  No NEW wholes in the access restrictions provided by the Linux kernel.
*  No NEW kernel code possibly introducing bugs.
*  No need to learn new mount options.
*  No NEW risks of usage errors.


Summary:
=2E.......
*  If UIDs differ on machines FORESEEN for file exchange, this is an
   administrator error, not a kernel deficit.
*  File exchange with an UNFORESEEN system requires root privileges anyway.



Thanks,
Roland Eggner
