Hi Mike,

those other patches were for other problems I was seeing: e.g.
interactivity/latency problems I was experiencing during heavy
flushing, etc. and some more - so I speculated that those would
improve it


OK, enough of that additional stuff which distracts from this issue -
I'll leave them out for now ...

Thanks for the info !

To console you: I was using v5 from Milan's patch up until now and I
haven't noticed any corruption with it in conjunction with 2.6.36

I modified it according to Milan's mail:

and that worked fine

Thanks for pointing to v6 ! I hadn't noticed that there was a new one :)

Well, so I'll restore my box to a working/productive state and will
try out v6 (I'm pretty confident that it'll work without problems).

After that I'll see what info Tejun and the others need when the next
corruption might occur with vanilla 2.6.37-rc* and v6 so that there's
something to investigate

Thanks & Regards

Matt
