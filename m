I think you mean "Roland" - you seem to disagree with Ludwig.

For the record I don't agree with Roland.. though I'm not 100% sure what he
is saying.  I cannot quite figure out what the "pipe" is that he is talking
about.

The thrust of the argument seems to be that by establishing good habits from
the very beginning you can avoid the need for change.  That may well be tru=
e,
but it isn't particularly "user friendly".  We should make things simple and
safe so that people don't *need* to carefully form good habits.

VFAT is indeed dominant.  But cannot handle files >4GB and cannot handle a
variety of special characters in file names.  But that isn't really relevan=
t.
Given that we have ext[234] rather than everyone using VFAT or NTFS
everywhere, we should make them as broadly usable as possible.  That path in
general encourages innovation.

"removable-media" means "The owner is the person holding the physical devic=
e,
not the person who knows the password which is stored in some databases alo=
ng
side some id which is attached to files in the filesystem".

So if I hold a device which has an ethernet port on which it talks NFS or
ISCSI, then yes: it is removable.

And this is not at all far-fetched.  Mobile internet devices (aka phones) a=
re
quite capable for serving NFS.  The current common practice where you need =
to
tell your device how to appear on the USB (mass storage?  media device?
propriety thingy?) is not very friendly.  If we just do IP (IPv6 of course)
to the devices (whether over USB or BT or Wifi) and provided every service
over that concurrently, that would be much better.

And with NFS, I could write to my uSD card in my smart-phone over the USB
cable at the same time that the phone itself was using the storage of other
purposes.  You cannot do that with usb/mass-storage/VFAT.

My access to files on that filesystem should not be guided by the uid of my
processes, but rather by the crypto-key that I made available.
And I suspect you can do exactly that using kerberos - and that is awesome.
We should have that access to ext4 over usb/mass storage too.

To make that clear: if I "own" a filesystem - whether because I hold the
physical non-encrypted devices or because I know the encryption key - then I
want to be able to  leverage that "ownership" to full access rights to
the contents of the filesystem.  By typing in a key or plugging in a device=
 I
want to get full "root" access to the filesystem on the device.  Not giving
that to me is just getting in my way.

ption.

It can certainly be used to cause a security breach, just as "rm -r" can be
used to cause data corruption.  We shouldn't disallow it for that reason
though.

The Linux NFS server has "all_squash" and "anon_uid=3D" export options.

>=20
> The root that mounts this FS can just copy+chmod or just-chmod them.

Sorry, I don't understand.  It sounds like you are suggesting that when I
mount an ext3 filesystem on my usb-stick, I should chmod -R all 3,000,000
files to make them world writeable?  Or maybe chown them all to me?  Or copy
them to my home directory?
And somehow this is safer than making it appear as though this has already
happened through mount options?
I must have misunderstood something.

> Next we'll see auto-mounters use these flags and goodbye file-access-cont=
rol.

Yes, of course auto-mounters will do this.  It makes perfect sense for any
removable (physically carry in my hand) media.  You cannot prevent data
destruction on such devices if you lose physical control, and the only
workable data privacy option is encryption.  Trying to pretend that file
permission bits mean anything is extremely naive.

I'm sure we could provide a CONFIG option for you.
