BTW, sorry - the patch clearly should've taken non-bdevs into account, but
I accept that wouldn't have been enough to evade a NAK.

btrfs is actually one of my main motivators - to quickly snapshot containers
with btrfs means that the containers all share one fs, but that means one
container can mark them all ro.
