But also, I believe this has been widely discussed in person by people, 
in separate groups. Maybe Tejun can do a small writeup of where we stand?

I would also point out that this is exactly what it is (IMHO): an 
ongoing discussion. You are more than welcome to chime in.

Agree. Even people aiming for unified hierarchies are okay with an 
opt-in/out system, I believe. So the controllers need not to be active 
at all times. One way of doing this is what I suggested to Frederic: If 
you don't limit, don't account.

see above.

Kame said that, not me. But FWIW, I don't disagree. And this is hardly 
gut feeling.

A big number of controllers creates complexity. When coding, we can 
assume a lot less things about their relationships, and more 
importantly: at some point people get confused. Fuck, sometimes *we* get 
confused about which controller do what, where its responsibility end 
and where the other's begin. And we're the ones writing it! Avoiding 
complexity is an engineering principle, not a gut feeling.

Now, of course, we should aim to make things as simple as possible, but 
not simpler: So you can argue that in Frederic's specific case, it is 
justified. And I'd be fine with that 100 %. If I agreed...

There are two natural points for inclusion here:

1) every cgroup has a task counter by itself. If we're putting the tasks 
there anyway, this provides a natural point of accounting.

2) The cpu cgroup, in the end, is the realm of the scheduler. We 
determine which % of the cpu the process will get, bandwidth, time spent 
by tasks, and all that. It is also more natural for that, because it is 
task based.

Don't get me wrong: I actually love the feature Frederic is working on.
I just don't believe a different controller is justified. Nor do I 
believe memcg is the place for that (specially now that I thought it 
overnight)
