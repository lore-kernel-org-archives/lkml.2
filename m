Simon:
My boxes definitely fall into the latter category, with spinlock
regularly sitting at 60-80% CPU (according to 'perf top'). As far as
predictability, not strictly, but it's typically after an uptime of
2-3 days. They take so long to get into this state that I've never
seen the actual transition in person, just the after-effects of
flush-0:xx gone crazy. These boxes have a number of other NFS mounts,
but it's on the flush-0:xx's for the heavily written-to NFS mounts
that are spinning wildly, which you'd expect to be the case. The
infrequently written-to NFS servers' flush-0:xx isn't to be found in
'top' output.

I'd booted into older kernels after my initial reply, so I'm 14 hrs
into booting a box back into 2.6.36.2 and another box into a
double-bisected 2.6.35-2.6.36 kernel (my first bisect hit compile
errors). Both are running normally but that fits with the pattern so
far.

NFS Guys:
Anything else we can be digging up to help debug this? This is a
pretty ugly issue.
