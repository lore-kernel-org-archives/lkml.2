I agree that it is probably not necessary for the current use of the sysfs API,
but if there was interest in expanding it to be usable for other purposes,
we might need to do something like what I am proposing. However, it doesn't
appear that anyone has any immediate need for doing so.

Correct.

Actually, its probably not worth the complexity to change much of anything in the
ipr driver. With the current users, ipr should be the only caller. If, for some
reason, we were double blocked due to ipr, the ipr driver already handles that today
just fine and having the second block essentially be a noop is fine, since we will
only get a single unblock due to ipr's reset state machine. If another caller is
added in the future, then we will need to make potential changes, but without knowing
the use case, its not clear to me what the proper action would be anyway.

Thanks,

Brian
