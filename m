Yeah, my initial patch did something similar (but inside the "if"
block). Ultimately, though I figured it was best to avoid setting
"inode" unless it was needed.

The patch I've got basically does that, but it's not as obvious as the
other way. Maybe I should just go ahead and try to clean up that logic
after all. Unrolling the error handling there is pretty nasty though.
