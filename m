We've consistently seen reports about corruptions on power hits with
dm-crypt.  The logs didn't have any messages about barriers failing, but
the corruptions were still there.  The most likely cause is that
barriers just aren't getting through somehow.

Right.

I think it would be best to move forward with just hammering on the
dm-crypt barriers:

http://oss.oracle.com/~mason/barrier-test

This script is the best I've found so far to reliably trigger
corruptions with barriers off.  I'd start with ext3 + barriers off just
to prove it corrupts things, then move to ext3 + barriers on.
