Ok, can you please explain to me what you mean here..?  As I really
thought we came to consensus that:

*) running in unlocked_qcmd=1 was to be made the default for LLDs using
the legacy optimization of ->queuecommand() -> unlock() ->
do_some_lld_work() -> lock() -> return to scsi_dispatch_cmd()

*) For the mpt-fusion / mpt2sas drivers which did not use the legacy
optimization, but Tim Chen has tested with the former and I am awaiting
an ACK from LSI on the latter.

*) All other drivers will function with host_lock held (eg: legacy mode)
in scsi_dispatch_cmd().

*) All drivers using cmd->serial_number for anything beyond an
informational purpose converted to use scsi_cmd_get_serial().

Not exactly correct, we have the whole thing ready right now with libfc
running unlocked_qcmd=0 legacy mode.

Once I verify START_STOP case in scsi_error.c, I am happy to respin a
mergeable tree from linus HEAD for you to pull ASAP.

Well, according to andmike this is two corner cases that are a result of
the drop-host_lock-v4 series using only blk_test_rq_complete() in
scsi_try_to_abort_cmd(), which will be true because of:

blk_rq_timed_out_timer() ->  blk_mark_rq_complete()

Sure, but I assume you mean the lock push down only for the legacy LLDs
that are not already internally unlocking host_lock in
SHT->queuecommand() in mainline code right..?
