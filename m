SCSI devices supporting Full task management model (almost all) and 
having QUEUE ALGORITHM MODIFIER bits in Control mode page set to 1 
allowed to freely reorder any commands with SIMPLE task attribute. If an 
application wants to maintain order of some commands for such devices, 
it must issue them with ORDERED task attribute and over a _single_ MPIO 
path to the device.

Linux neither uses ORDERED attribute, nor honors or enforces anyhow 
QUEUE ALGORITHM MODIFIER bits, nor takes care to send commands with 
order dependencies (overlapping writes in our case) over a single MPIO path.

How can it find the SN? The commands were sent over _different_ MPIO 
paths to the device, so at the moment of the sending all the order 
information was lost.

Until SCSI generally allowed to preserve ordering information between 
MPIO paths in such configurations the only way to maintain commands 
order would be queue draining. Hence, for safety all initiators working 
with such devices must do it.

But looks like Linux doesn't do it, so unsafe with MPIO clusters?
