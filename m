That is very brittle. I'd prefer not to have to scan linux-mm every week
in order to find out if someone changed the page_count.

However, while reading Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt (in order to
add documentation for freepage) I was surprised to read that the
->releasepage() is itself supposed to be allowed to actually remove the
page from the address space if it so desires.

Looking at the actual code in shrink_page_list() and friends I can't see
how that can possibly fail to break things, but if it were true, then
that might enable us to call remove_mapping() in order to safely free
the page before it gets cleared.

Cheers
