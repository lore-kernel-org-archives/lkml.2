OK, thanks for clarifying.  This confirms that the general approach I
took in this patch is correct.  It remains to be seen if Jens is
agreeable with blk_clear_request_payload.

I know Christoph thought my introduction and use of
blk_clear_request_payload was reasonable.  Christoph, please feel free
to add your Ack to this patch if you approve.

I look forward to feedback from Tomo and Jens now too.  Hopefully Jens
will pick this patch up.

regards,
Mike
