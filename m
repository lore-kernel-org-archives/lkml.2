select, since we have it, should be clean ... as in if you select
something, you don't have to expose yourself to a huge pile of missing
depends that only show up in obscure configurations.

The object of select is not to trip up the user.  If we used a purely
depend based configuration, the user would have to know to select, say,
the right SCSI transport classes before they get presented with drivers.
It's completely correct, since transport classes are internal
implementations, to have the user select drivers and Kconfig work out
via the select directive what transport classes are needed.

This is what I don't understand.

Actually I think the whole premise of the patch (to get back to the
original topic) is wrong.

TARGET_CORE depends on SCSI; SCSI has to have sysfs to survive ... we
just don't work without it yet we neither select nor depend on it.
SYSFS is only deselectable for embedded anyway, so I think the
configuration which generated this whole argument was likely a bogus one
and consequently, none of the patches are needed (or if they are,
they're the tip of the iceberg).
