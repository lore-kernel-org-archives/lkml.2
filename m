I believe that's by design. The comments at the top of slab.c say:

 * This means, that your constructor is used only for newly allocated
 * slabs and you must pass objects with the same initializations to
 * kmem_cache_free.

I assume that it was done that way for efficiency, but not passing
"clean" objects to kmem_cache_free has been the source of bugs in the
past.

Rerunning the ctor should be safe. SLAB already does that when memory
poisoning is enabled. Perhaps we could make sure all the allocators do
that when debug objects are enabled?

OTOH, doing that might paper over bugs in some cases...
