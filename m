Ok. So it's not really a creation date, exactly the same way ctime
isn't at all a creation date.

And maybe that actually hints at a better solution: maybe a better
model is to create a new per-thread flag that says "do ctime updates
the way windows does them".

So instead of adding another "btime" - which isn't actually what even
windows does - just admit that the _real_ issue is that Unix and
Windows semantics are different for the pre-existing "ctime".

The fact is, windows has "access time", "modification time" and
"creation time" _exactly_ like UNIX. It's just that the ctime has
slightly different semantics in windows vs unix. So quite frankly,
it's totally insane to introduce a "birthtime", when that isn't even
what windows wants, just because people cannot face the actual real
difference.

Tell me why we shouldn't just do this right?
