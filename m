Ok, how about a second proposal:

1. Put the sysfs knob and the toggle code in the block layer, similar to patch
#1, only make it a per-bdev toggle so each mount can have its own override
parameters.

2. Add some sort of "nocacheflush" option to the VFS layer to adjust the knob.
With this we gain a consistent mount option syntax across all the filesystems,
though what it means for a networked fs is questionable.  I guess you could
reject the mount option if there's no block device under the fs.  Also, any fs
that someday grows an issue-flush feature won't have to add its own option
parsing code.

At umount time, do we undo whatever overrides we set up at mount time?  Seems
sane to me, just wanted to run it by everyone.

3. Change the per-fs option handling code to call the same code as the VFS'
nocacheflush option.  Any fs that wants to deprecate its per-fs option handler
can do so.  Or they can stay forever.

4. Remove all the flush conditionals from the fs code in favor of letting the
block layer handle it.

Hopefully "nocacheflush" is a little more obvious.
