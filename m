Yeah.  That'll work for NFSv4.  But if possible it'd be nice to have a
solution for NFSv3.

As compared to using a higher-resolution time source, a solution for
mtime based on a global counter would provide better guarantees (on
filesystems that can store the extra bits), and perform better.  (What
is the worst-case latency if we're bouncing a cache line back and forth
between two CPU's?)  Though I guess the possible performance hit would
rule it out for users that didn't specifically ask for it.  (So, no help
for userspace nfs servers, make, or whoever else might (wisely or not)
already depend on mtime detecting changes reliably.)

Got it.  Thanks for your help!
