I do still think you need _something_ there, otherwise data can remain
in the direct map alias and not be visible via the vmap alias.  I don't
see that we have anything in place to handle this at present though.

jejb mentioned something about making kunmap_atomic() always flush the
cache, even for lowmem pages, but I think that's going to be exceedingly
painful, to the extent that I believe it will prevent our PIO-only MMC
drivers working - or we need a scatterlist API that will let drivers
iterate over the scatterlist without needing to continually kmap_atomic
and kunmap_atomic each page.
