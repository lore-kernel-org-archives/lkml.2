  Deprecating BH_Ordered is fine but I wouldn't introduce new BH flags for
this. BH flags should be used for buffer state, not for encoding how the
buffer should be written (there were actually bugs in the past because of
this). Being able to set proper flags when calling submit_bh() in the rw
parameter is enough.
