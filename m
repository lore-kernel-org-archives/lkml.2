right, and all for that dmesg print. But yes! 

Well the 3.1 Kernel without them gets stuck. I guess you need to experiment
with what would be the minimal patchset needed for 3.1 .

Tell me if you need help testing that the damage has gone. But basically I have
a script (4 years old) that does: 
	server: service nfs stop/start 
	client: mount
back to back, The client gets stuck forever.
