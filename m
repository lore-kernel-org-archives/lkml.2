This type of change would likely cause a huge cascade of errors in real
removable media devices.  Under the MMC standards, which a lot of the
older removable discs seem to follow, UNIT ATTENTION indicates either
medium change or device reset (which we check for and eat lower down);
we can't rely on them giving proper SBC-2 sense codes.  If you want to
pretend to be removable media, you have to conform to its standards.
