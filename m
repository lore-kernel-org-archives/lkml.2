Vivek, thanks for pointing this out.  Sounds like we need to think
carefully about whether the potential unfairness that this patch might
impose on other workloads sharing the file system dominates the
improvements that Jeff found when there's only a single workload
running on the file system.

I'm tentatively leaning towards pulling this patch so we can do more
testing / benchmarking.   Jeff, any thoughts or comments?
