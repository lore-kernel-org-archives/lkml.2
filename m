IMO updating file times should happen when changes get written out, not
when a page is made writable, for two reasons:

1. Correctness.  With the current approach, it's very easy for files to
be changed after the last mtime update -- any changes between mkwrite
and actual writeback won't affect mtime.

2. Performance.  I have an application (presumably guessable from my
email address) for which blocking in page_mkwrite is an absolute
show-stopper.  (In fact it's so bad that we reverted back to running on
Windows until I hacked up a kernel to not do this.)  I have an incorrect
patch [1] to fix it, but I haven't gotten around to a real fix.  (I also
have stable pages reverted in my kernel.  Some day I'll submit a patch
to make it a filesystem option.  Or maybe it should even be a block
device / queue property like the alignment offset and optimal io size --
there are plenty of block device and file combinations which don't
benefit at all from stable pages.)

I'd prefer if file_update_time in page_mkwrite didn't proliferate.  A
better fix is probably to introduce a new inode flag, update it when a
page is undirtied, and then dirty and write the inode from the writeback
path.  (Kind of like my patch, but with an inode flag instead of a page
flag, and with the file_update_time done from the fs.)
