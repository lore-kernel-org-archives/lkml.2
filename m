Er?  Where does ->d_revalidate() exist in fs/autofs4?  Mainline doesn't
have anything of that kind...

OK, now I'm really confused.  Where does your tree live?

I really don't like the look of autofs4_tree_busy(), BTW - you don't need
RCU to get races here; just a plain chdir("../../.."); done by a process
that sits deep enough in subtree you are checking can very well race with
your check, so that your iterator gets through the new cwd before chdir()
and through the old one after it...

Maybe I'm missing something subtle here.  A braindump on how you expect
all "we choose dentry for expiry" stuff to work and what is really required
from it would be nice...

Could you _please_ forward to him the question I tried to ask, without
any success so far?  Namely, what was the reason for reverting do_filp_open()
to use of do_path_lookup() in non-create case?  I have a couple of guesses,
but...
