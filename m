Cool, finally something interesting :). So, how it'll work ? Does that
require any format changes again:) ? Can you exclude the whole root and
then selectively pick the directories or files you are interested in ?

How does rollback work with ext4 snapshots ? Can you selectively roll
back one file, or the whole directory subtree even when you're
snapshotting more ?

You see, when it comes to the full fs snapshots I am not convinced that
it is *very* useful, yes it might have some users, but you can alway
take the safe way and do lvm snapshots (or better use the new multisnap)
for backup, without need to modify stable filesystem code.

Also, I do not buy the whole argument of "not have to create separate disk
space for snapshot". It is actually better for sysadmins, because you
have perfect control on what is going on, how much space is used for
your snapshots and how much is used by your data. You can always easily
extend the snapshot volume, or let it die silently when it is too old
and too big.

How does it actually work on ext4 snapshots ? When you're going to
rewrite a file, you will never know how much disk space it'll take in
advance, am I right ? Is the filesystem accounting for the snapshot size
as well ? or is it hidden ?

Thanks!
