Instead of adding a comment like this please fix whatever issue you
found or at least report it to the the people that might be able to
fix if you don't understand the code well enough.

We make sure to not dirty any new inodes after the first phase of the
freeze, so this should be a BUG_ON/WARN_ON.

What exactly deadlock?  The comment as-is really doesn't tell the reader
anything interesting.  Note that switching it to a trylock really should
be a separate patch.  We've been through it a while ago and it got lost,
and now Miao Xie is looking into the general issue again.

Also as mentioned to Miao Xie a little elarier
writeback_inodes_if_idle should be rewritten to be a trivial wrapper
around writeback_inodes_sb_nr_if_idle instead of duplicating the logic.

While we're at it:  can anyway suggest a less cumbersome name than
writeback_inodes_sb_if_idle?  I'd go for
try_to_writeback_inodes_sb(_nr).

Again, this should be a BUG_ON/WARN_ON.  We shouldn't redirty quotas
after the freeze.

How about spending the three minutes to figure it out?
Q_GETFMT/Q_GETINFO/Q_XGETQSTAT and Q_GETQUOTA are the obvious read-only
candidates.

That's an overgeneralization.

Please split adding this useful documentation into a separate patch.

Again, BUG_ON/WARN_ON.

Same here.

Same here.

wrong brace placement.
