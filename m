It can bring benefits for both CIFS and NFS filesystems - so, at least 
two ones.

It makes us add such checks for all other filesystems, if I understand 
right, - not a problem, I think.

Ideally we should not make any difference between underlying 
filesystems in Wine: an application requests an open of the file and we 
issue this open with flags it passed. Since Wineserver can process share 
flags locally itself (for one linux user), we only need to add this 
support for CIFS (that is actively used by Wine applications because of 
it's Windows nature). Bringing these flags for local filesystems can 
benefit Wine too: it will help in cases when Wine applications of 
different users on the same machine use the same file and can make all 
those things easier, of course.

The problem is the possibility of denial-of-service attacks here. We 
can try to prevent them by:
1) specifying an extra security bit on the file that indicates that 
share flags are accepted (like we have for mandatory locks now) and 
setting it for neccessary files only, or
2) adding a special mount option (but it it probably makes sense if we 
decided to add this support for CIFS and NFS only).
