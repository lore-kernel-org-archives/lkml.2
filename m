See the Tejun's explanation again:
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=128267361813859&w=2
What I'm concerning is whether the same thing as Tejun explained
for ATA can happen on other types of devices.


Normal write command has data and no data loss happens on error.
So it can be retried cleanly, and if the result of the retry is
success, it's really success, no implicit data loss.

Normal read command has a sector to read.  If the sector is broken,
all retries will fail and the error will be reported upwards.
So it can be retried cleanly as well.

Thanks,
Kiyoshi Ueda
