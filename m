So 1. comes directly from what you quote below.  The sysfs thing is
buried in another long thread that I can't be bothered to dig through
and 3. is a basic requirement from anything for inclusion.

To be honest, I can't see how you arrive at that interpretation from the
quote below.  It specifically says "what it comes down to is that if we
had a kernel side protocol accelerator for STGT, the project would no
longer suffer from this theoretical failing. *Both* of you have such a
thing embedded in your respective submissions (all 74k LOC of them) so
can't you just enhance STGT with whichever one is better?"  That's
reluctant acceptance, not the blanket refusal you ascribe to it.
