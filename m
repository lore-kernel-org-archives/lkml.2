It is missing a signed-off-by:, and please quote the warning message
when fixing warnings.

Also, this patch fixes a bug, doesn't it?  323b controllers simply
won't work?

James, it's needed in .37 please.

drivers/scsi/hpsa.c:93:1: warning: "PCI_DEVICE_ID_HP_CISSF" redefined
In file included from include/linux/pci.h:58,
                 from drivers/scsi/hpsa.c:25:
include/linux/pci_ids.h:746:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition

PCI_DEVICE_ID_CISSF is defined as 323b in pci_ids.h but redefined as 3fff in
hpsa.c. The ID of 3fff will _never_ ship as a standalone controller. It is
intended only as part a complete storage solution. As such, this patch
removes the redefinition and the StorageWorks P1210m from the product table.

It also removes a duplicate line for the "unknown" controller support.
