Well the PID is a racy construct when used by another task than the
parent... fortunately, most userland code can cope with it ! :)

The race still exists: openpid() is being passed a PID... Only the
parent can legitimately know that this PID identifies a specific
unwaited child.

Indeed, the idea of not exposing a PID from another namespace sounds
nice.
