The generic implementation of ->page_mkwrite  (block_page_mkwrite())
which XFS uses has never had a wait_on_page_writeback() call in it.
There's no call in the generic write paths, either, hence my comment
that only direct IO on XFS will work.

It should be noted that metadata updates in XFS are already
protected against torn writes - buffers are held locked during IO,
and can only be modified while holding the lock. Hence the only
problem that needs solving for XFS to make full use of DIF/DIX is
getting the page cache paths to not modify pages under IO...


Cheers,

Dave.
