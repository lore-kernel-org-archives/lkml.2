Why not lift that limitation before the first version is committed upstream?

As far as I see we have to allocate multiple target ids if we want
to provide multipath (e.g. 8 target ids if there are 8 pathes, thus limiting
ourselves to 64 targets, no?)

As a compromise between space/flexibility, cant we just split the 4 bytes
in a similar fashion as our major/minor numbers (12/20bit)?

In the mainframe area I have seen real-life problems hitting the 64k 
device limit for disks (mostly due to multipathing), it was extended
afterwards, but every extension tends to make an interface less
appealing. (look at some virtio drivers and you will find places
were feature bits made the code "less pretty")

Performance might be fixed later, but the interface is then settled.

Again, why not now? Any extension would require a feature bit, no?
Is there a technical reason why a fixed 1 here is better than just using that space
as scsi id? (e.g. hash table sizes, lookup etc)

PS: what puzzles me as well, is the fact that struct virtio_scsi_cmd_req has lun[8]
in the structure. That would sum up as 5 bytes wasted of those 8, no?
