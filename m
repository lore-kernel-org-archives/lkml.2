That's the ideal situation, but shit happens, and losing a long-running
job can often be an expensive proposition.

I've not made up my mind about anything, and in any case it's not my
decision to make. I think you need to convince Trond here... :)

I'm quite open to sane proposals as long as we can accomodate those who
are dependent on the current behavior. As I said before, when I
originally did the patches a couple of years ago, I sort of figured the
current behavior was a first approximation.

A mount option will be harder to implement than a rpc.gssd command-line
option, but it sounds reasonable. Still, it would be better not to have
to make this an either/or decision somehow.
