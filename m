Actually, I take all that back: the driver has a bug in QUEUE_FULL
handling: twa_scsi_queue() calls twa_scsiop_execute_scsi(), which maps
the dma buffer, but if the card responds QUEUE_FULL it just returns
SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY without ever unmapping.  That leg in the code
frees the request but also doesn't unmap it.  In fact any error return
from twa_scsiop_execute_scsi() seems to have the same problem (but
QUEUE_FULL is the only silent one).

I trust Adam will fix this.
