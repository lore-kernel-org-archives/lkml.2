syslogd definitely should (and does) perform escaping of control chars
for logs written through it.

How?  We can't realistically expect everyone to stop invoking dmesg
directly.  Moreover, this is sometimes useful, although someone who is
aware of the risk and who cares about it would do "dmesg | less".  The
problem is that most people are not aware, and we can't change that.

Right.
