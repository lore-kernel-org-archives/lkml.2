We want to ZPODD always to be suspended and resumed along with the ATA
port.

Below is part of the GPE handler for ZPODD device attention event.

        Scope (\_GPE)
        {
            Method (_L13, 0, NotSerialized)
            {
                ADBG ("ZPODD DA Event")
                ....

                Notify (\_SB.PCI0.SAT0.PRT2, 0x02)
                ....
            }
        }

It maybe a bit confused, but actually, \_SB.PCI0.SAT0.PRT2 is bind to
the attached device, not the ata port itself.

See below commit in linux-next tree.
75d22c(libata: Bind the Linux device tree to the ACPI device tree)

And below notify handler(PATCH 6) will resume the attached device(CDROM
in ZPODD case).

+static void ata_acpi_wake_dev(acpi_handle handle, u32 event, void *context)
+{
+       struct ata_device *ata_dev = context;
+
+       if (event == ACPI_NOTIFY_DEVICE_WAKE && ata_dev)
+               scsi_autopm_get_device(ata_dev->sdev);
+}
+

But the code to power on/power off the device is in ata_acpi_set_state,
which is called when ata port is resumed/suspended.

ata_eh_handle_port_resume/suspend
    ata_acpi_set_state
        ata_for_each_dev {
            acpi_bus_set_power(<the acpi handle of the device>, acpi_state)
        }

Could you take a look at PATCH 6?
It's more clear over there.

Thanks,
Lin Ming
