Dunno, it looks obvious now, I just missed the entry&leave implicit
barriers by spinlocks and again sorry about the confusion.

But single mutex is just ugly.

I think this is a good example because it shows how to share the state
without too many implementation details.

I think the locking is fine and I would keep it this way rather than a
big lock.

more doc cannot hurt ;)
