I thought the later cleanups would be on top of the series.

Hohumm, I have tried to apply the series on top of Linus' 3.6 and there
were no conflicts so I can create a branch which you can pull into your
cgroup branch (which I can then merge into -mm git tree).
This would however mean that those patches wouldn't fly through Andrew's
tree. Is this really what we want and what does it give to us?

I can surely imagine that (for the memcg part) but it needs throughout
review.
