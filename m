I don't understand this.

Why would it make a difference whether SCSI is modular at hybernation
resume time?  The reason it makes a difference at boot time is because
there's no initrd to wait for the scans and mount the root if we're not
modular, so the init path has to do it.  However, when resuming an
image, the module is already loaded into that image, so there should be
no difference at all between steps taken in the modular and non-modular
cases.
