Yes, of course.  However, with dozens of queues, many of them will share 
the same vector and all of them will be examined when you get the 
interrupt.  Even if you find the right balance between sharing (because 
you have to) and separating (because of scalability), I wouldn't be 
surprised if more than 255 targets do not work too well.

Anyway multiqueue is not even in this patchset, so there's more work to 
do before we can worry. :)
