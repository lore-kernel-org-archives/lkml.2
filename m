Hi. Wu.
Okay, I have a question.

If making dirty_writeback_interval per bdi to tune short interval
instead of background_time, We can get similar performance
improvement.
/sys/block/<device>/bdi/dirty_writeback_interval
/sys/block/<device>/bdi/dirty_expire_interval

NFS write performance improvement is just one usecase.

If we can set interval/time per bdi,  other usecases will be created
by applying.

How do you think ?

Thanks.
