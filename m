Yep, Linus has already suggested a similar thing:
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/27/4

As to random bytes - if it is very predictable (e.g. rand() % 10000) one
may restore the original value.  But it would still do much harm to good
programs (io stats going up and down!).  Adding really random bytes
seems somewhat too complicated for these needs to me.

As to rounding - this is a workaround, not a fix.  What if some program
reads one byte from tty and then do some io activity exactly of 1kb-1?
Then you just measure kbs and get original tty activity.  (just a crazy
example to show that it is not a full solution.)


Without any proof/estimate, just an idea: it's possible to get not only
password length, which needs as much granularity as possible, but
another information, which doesn't need any strict value.  E.g.
statistics changing, what should indicate that some significant event
has just happened.

In the code I see taskstats statistics is kept untouched, so it would
break userspace assumptions about the statistics.

(the same should go into the taskstats fix) 

Looks sane, thank you!
