  Not many but some... The alternative to less blocking approach is to do
copy-out before a page is submitted for IO (or various middle ground
alternatives of doing sometimes copyout, sometimes blocking...). That costs
some performance as well. We talked about it at LSF and the approach
Darrick is implementing was considered the least intrusive. There's really
no way to fix these corner cases and keep performance. But indeed a plain
SATA drive or a USB stick don't need stable pages so they wouldn't need to
pay the cost. So it would be beneficial if the underlying block device
propagated whether it needs stable writes or not and filesystem could turn
on stable pages accordingly.
