You should be OK, there. Are you using encryption or no?
I had difficulty replicating the issue without encryption.

Normally it's /var/lib/pgsql/data/pgsql_tmp (or
/var/lib/postgres/data/pgsql_tmp in your case). By placing
/var/lib/{postgresql,pgsql}/data on the LUKS + ext4 volume, on both
openSUSE 11.3 and Kubuntu, I was able to replicate the problem easily,
in VirtualBox. I can give qemu a try. In both cases I was using a
2.6.37x kernel.
