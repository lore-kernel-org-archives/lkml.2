  Oh, right. kjournald writing buffers directly (without setting
PageWriteback) will break things. So please, change warning to:

	/*
	 * In data=ordered mode, kjournald writes buffers without setting
	 * PageWriteback bit thus generic code does not properly wait for
	 * writeback of those buffers to finish.
	 */
	if (!read_only &&
	    test_opt(sb, DATA_FLAGS) == EXT3_MOUNT_ORDERED_DATA &&
	    queue_requires_stable_pages(bdev_get_queue(sb->s_bdev))) {
		ext3_msg(sb, KERN_ERR,
			"error: data=ordered mode does not support stable "
			"page writes required by the disk; forcing read-only "
			"mode. Upgrading to ext4 is recommended.");
		res = MS_RDONLY;
	}

then you need a similar check in ext3_remount() so that filesystem cannot
be remounted read-write.
