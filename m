Subject: [PATCH 3/9 v2] cgroup: implement generic child / descendant walk
 macros
Message-ID: <20121108175946.GA9672@htj.dyndns.org>

Currently, cgroup doesn't provide any generic helper for walking a
given cgroup's children or descendants.  This patch adds the following
three macros.

* cgroup_for_each_child() - walk immediate children of a cgroup.

* cgroup_for_each_descendant_pre() - visit all descendants of a cgroup
  in pre-order tree traversal.

* cgroup_for_each_descendant_post() - visit all descendants of a
  cgroup in post-order tree traversal.

All three only require the user to hold RCU read lock during
traversal.  Verifying that each iterated cgroup is online is the
responsibility of the user.  When used with proper synchronization,
cgroup_for_each_descendant_pre() can be used to propagate state
updates to descendants in reliable way.  See comments for details.

v2: s/config/state/ in commit message and comments per Michal.  More
    documentation on synchronization rules.

+ * As long as the inheriting step, including checking the parent state, is

+ * visible by walking order and, as long as inheriting operations to the
+ * same @pos are atomic to each other, multiple updates racing each other
+ * still result in the correct state.  It's guaranateed that at least one
+ * inheritance happens for any cgroup after the latest update to its
+ * parent.
+ *
+ * If checking parent's state requires locking the parent, each inheriting
+ * iteration should lock and unlock both @pos->parent and @pos.
+ *
+ * Alternatively, a subsystem may choose to use a single global lock to
+ * synchronize ->post_create() and ->pre_destroy() against tree-walking
