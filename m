Although the lifetime of d_ino might very, I know some programs (not
public) that will break if they see a d_ino which is wrongly matching
the st_ino of another file somewhere on the same st_dev.  They will
assume the name is a hard link to the other file, without calling
stat(), which I think is a reasonable assumption and a useful optimisation.

So the made-up d_ino should at least be careful to not match an inode
number of another file which has a stable st_ino.

Why not zero for d_ino?
