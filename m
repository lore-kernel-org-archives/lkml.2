This is the option I'm attempting for now. I'm quite fine with the page
only being readable while under the page lock since this is readdir, and
so we don't have to worry about mmap() and its ilk.

My latest incarnation of the patches has added in all the PagePrivate()
foo to make try_to_release_page() work, and also adds in an
invalidatepage() address space operation (I rediscovered that
truncate_inode_pages() will otherwise call block_invalidatepage, and
subsequently Oops).

I'm still in the process of testing, but the latest patchset appears to
be doing all the right things for now. I'll post an update later today
so that Nick and others can test too.

Cheers
