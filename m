You have a right assumption. This is exactly what I'm going to do next.

This solution is not the simplest one since we call svc_register() for every svc 
socket if it's not anonymous. But svc_unregister() is called only once for all 
inet families and protocols.

Also I've noticed, that we call svc_unregister in __svc_create(). I.e. we call 
it for nfs callbacks as well (in spite of that we don't need this). Thus, for 
now, nfs callbacks service creation depends on rpcbind clients presence.

So, for my pow, we need something like startup() callback, passed to 
svc_create(_pooled)() to clean up this mess.
This callback will be defined only for lockd and nfsd and will create rpcbind 
clients and remove any stale portmap registrations.
