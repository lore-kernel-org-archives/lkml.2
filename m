 Yes, the extra indirection is a bit of a negative, but I don't think this
 patch is harder to review than the alternate.
 From a numerical perspective, with this patch you only need to look at the
 various places that ->readdir is called to be sure it is always correct.
 There are about 3.  With the original you need to look at ever filldir
 function.  Jan has found 9.  

 And from a maintainability perspective, I think my approach is safer.  Given
 that there are 9 filldir functions already, the chance that a need will be
 found for another seems good, and the chance that the coder will know to
 check for DT_WHT is a best even.  Conversely if another call to ->readdir
 were added it is likely that nothing would need to be done.

 Of course just counting things doesn't give a completely picture but I think
 it can be indicative.
