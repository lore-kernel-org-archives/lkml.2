NFS supports the deny-read and deny-write bits but not deny-delete.

If we could do such opens in-kernel on local and clustered filesystems,
that could also be useful for multi-protocol (Samba and NFS) and
clustered exports.

Currently knfsd tries to enforce deny bits in the nfsd code, which is a
bit ugly.

And knfsd currently requires write permissions for deny-read.  My
understanding is that Windows considers that wrong, but I'd be curious
to know whether that breaks Windows applications in practice.
