And what if assuming JIT BPF would be default enabled?

I'll do my best.

The current JIT doesn't handle negative offsets: The stuff that's handled
by __load_pointer(). Easiest solution would be to make it non-static and
call it instead of doing bpf_error. I guess __load_pointer was added later
and the JIT code didn't get updated.

But gcc refuses to inline load_pointer, instead it inlines __load_pointer
and does the important checks first. Considering the current assembly code
does a call too, it could as well call load_pointer() directly. That would
save a lot of assembly code, handle all negative cases too and be pretty
much the same speed. The only question is if this slow down some other
archs than x86. What do you think?

The EMIT_COND_JMP(f_op, f_offset); should be in an else case, otherwise
it's superfluous. It's a harmless bug though. I haven't spotted anything
else yet.

You can get rid of all the "if (is_imm8(offsetof(struct sk_buff, len)))"
code by making sure everything is near: Somewhere at the start, just
add 127 to %rdi and a BUILD_BUG_ON(sizeof(struct sk_buff) > 255).

I'll write some more patches tomorrow.

Greetings,

Indan
