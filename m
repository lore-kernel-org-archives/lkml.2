Yes, we did.  Everyone agrees structured logging would be the best long
term solution.  However, it's at least 10x the work presented here, plus
it would be a long process getting everyone to agree.  This looks like a
good 95% interim solution and it can be removed when structured logging
makes everything "just work(tm)".

I have also seen a couple of other attempts at structured logging which
both failed when the people proposing the patches realised how much work
it actually was, so I'm a bit sceptical we'll ever get there.  But hey,
you have the enthusiasm, propose it as a KS topic to get agreement that
we should do it and what the format should be and we can go from there.
