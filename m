Sorry Vlad, but this is simply not the truth.  You have had ample time
to comment on the hundreds of TCM/LIO patches posted to linux-scsi and
lkml over the last years, but you have chosen never to comment on a
*single* one then, or even on a single one now of the dozens that have
been posted in the last 3 weeks while this thread has been lumbering
forward..

So at this point, I will once again to refrain from any non technical
interaction with yourself.  If you have geninue concerns about any of
the TCM/LIO v4 code, then I suggest that you and your devels make them
known from within threads containing [PATCH] and [RFC] tags, because I
will not be bothering with anything that does not contain comments on
creating new or improving existing design and code.

Best,
