None.  Use 'struct device'

I have multiple times.

That doesn't matter.  They are still "devices" that the kernel knows
about and as such, fit into the device tree of everything in the kernel.

It's the duty of a subsystem's maintainer to enforce the correct model
of the kernel, and that is what I am doing.

Again, this is the last email I'm writing on this topic, as none of the
previous ones seem to be sinking in.
