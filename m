Hmmm good point..  Perhaps the choice of using struct iscsi_cmd as the
example w/ __be32 header_digest was made a little hastely on my part.
8-)

So in that case, I can focus making this struct iscsi_cmd function W/O
the header_digest member first, and have the temporary stubs in the
lio-core-2.6.git tree for the other PDUs as required until the other non
SCSI PDU handlers can be converted and the stubs removed.

Great!  I am looking forward to those.

<nod> I would like to start adding BIDI into TCM Core + TCM_Loop very
soon (mabye by this weekend..?)  Ditto on the extended > 16-byte CDB
support bit, which should be straight-forward enough in TCM Core, and on
the backend for the TCM/pSCSI using struct request passthrough..

Ok, I need start to putting this together in Documentation/target/ for
the lio-target iSCSI specific pieces..  My plan is to start working on
the struct target_core_fabric_ops API documentation first to go with
this tcm_mod_builder.py configfs skeleton fabric module generation
script that I am considering.

>From there, it would next make sense to produce high level docs for
struct se_subsystem_api and primary Linux storage subsystem plugins eg:
IBLOCK, pSCSI, FILEIO for folks interested in that area.

I will be sure to CC you for input on these doc commits.

This is the lio-core-2.6.git/lio-4.0 branch which is currently still at
v2.6.35.  Just FYI I plan to jump to .36-rc2 at some point during the
week.
