Should I propose an extra error code?  Perhaps giving:

	ENONAMESERVICE	"Network name service unavailable"
	ENAMEUNKNOWN	"Network name not known"
	ENONAMERECORD	"Network name query returned no records"

Note that ENONAMESERVICE covers all of: not having a name service configured,
not being able to contact the configured name server and the configured name
server not being able to chain to the authoritative name server.  However, I
think this is probably okay.
