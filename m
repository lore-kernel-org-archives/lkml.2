The struct scsi_cmnd that was passed to scsi_log_send() was already freed
(contents completely 6b6b6b...).
Since SLUB debugging was turned on we can see that it was freed from
__scsi_put_command(). Not too much of a surprise.

In addition it might be worthwhile to apply this small slub patch as well,
so that we get a full trace of the caller in the object which was freed:
