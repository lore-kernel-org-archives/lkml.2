Hi Reboert,

Thanks for your reply.  Actually, we met a problem in our product
system.  We have thousands of database servers that run on Linux.
These servers have a lot of SATA disks that support FUA feature.
However, it displays that the disk doesn't support FUA in dmesg.  I
digged this problem and found that libata_fua variable is set to 0 to
disable FUA detection for SATA disk.  If FUA feature can be used, we
could disable io_barrier to improve the performance.  Now one solution
is that we set libata_fua to 1 when this kernel module is loaded.  But
it needs to modify initrd file, and it is too complicated for
administrator who needs to modify every server manually.  So that
enabling FUA detection is another solution.  Have you any other idea
to solve this problem?  Thank you.

Regards,
Zheng
