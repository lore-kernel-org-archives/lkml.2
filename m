Sorry for short sentences :)  I tried the patch you've suggested -
initialize rw_mutex in the init_ipc_ns declaration.  Surely, it solves a
specific race.  As no kernel threads actually use shm, other fields are
not needed to be initialized before do_initcall().

However, it is a bit ugly as it divides namespace initialization code
into init_ipc_ns initialization and other namespaces.  It's better to
use the same code for all namespaces (as it currently is).

I mean it is a bug of _implicit_ assume that kthreads don't use ns
related information.  So, AFAICS, it can be fixed 2 ways:

1) Move creations of kernel threads somewhere after namespaces
initializations in the init chain.

2) Deferring threads creation until all ns initialization is done.

I don't speak about specific bugs (I know the only one, which is this shm
related bug), but I suppose some threads might use some ns related
information as well.  At least I don't see whether it is somehow
explicitly denied currently.

Thanks,
