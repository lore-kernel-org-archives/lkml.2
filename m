Thank you for your very clear explanation.

Going without writeback cache is a problem (write performance sucks as 
you say), but guaranteeing to never reach ENOSPC also is hardly 
feasible, especially if humans are logged at client side and they are 
doing "whatever they want".

I would suggest that either be the NFS client to do polling to see if 
it's near an ENOSPC and if yes disable writeback caching, or be the 
server to do the polling and if it finds out it's near-ENOSPC condition 
it sends a specific message to clients to warn them so that they can 
disable caching.

Performed at client side wouldn't change the NFS protocol and can be 
good enough if one can specify how often freespace should be polled and 
what is the freespace threshold. Or with just one value: specify what is 
the max speed at which server disk can fill (next polling period can be 
inferred from current free space), and maybe also specify a minimum 
polling period (just in case).

Regarding the last part of the email, perhaps I was not clear:

No, in that case I had written 15x100MB which was more than the 
available space but less than available+writeback_cache.
So "cat" ended by itself and never got an ENOSPC error but data never 
reached the disk at the other side.

However today I found that by using fsync, the problem is fortunately 
detected:

# time cat randfile{001..015} | pv -b | dd conv=fsync 
of=/mnt/nfsram/randfile
1.46GB
dd: fsync failed for `/mnt/nfsram/randfile': Input/output error
3072000+0 records in
3072000+0 records out
1572864000 bytes (1.6 GB) copied, 20.9101 s, 75.2 MB/s

real    0m21.364s
user    0m0.470s
sys     0m11.440s


so ok I understand that processes needing guarantees on written data 
should use fsync/fdatasync (which is good practice also for a local 
filesystem actually...)

Thank you
