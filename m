  Well, the part you might be missing is:
        ext4_free_blocks_count_set(es,
                        EXT4_C2B(EXT4_SB(sb), percpu_counter_sum_positive(
                                &EXT4_SB(sb)->s_freeclusters_counter)));
        es->s_free_inodes_count =
                cpu_to_le32(percpu_counter_sum_positive(
                                &EXT4_SB(sb)->s_freeinodes_counter));
  percpu_counter_sum() *is* rather expensive. At least for big machines.

  Also just marking the buffer dirty more corresponds to what we do when
journalling.

  Yes, that would be nice but it's not easy to do currently...
