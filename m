  Actually, we already write-protect the page in clear_page_dirty_for_io
so the first part already happens. Any filesystem can do
wait_on_page_writeback() in its ->page_mkwrite function so even the second
part shouldn't be hard. I'm just a bit worried about the performance
implications / hidden deadlocks...
  Also we'd have to wait_on_page_writeback() in ->write_begin function to
protect against ordinary writes  but that's the easy part...
