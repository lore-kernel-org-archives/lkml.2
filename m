SG_IO itself is a bypassing interface.  It bypasses most of block
layer and the kernel doesn't have any idea (apart from the adhoc
filtering) about what's going on.  The problem can be approached from
both directions (make use of OS IO layer improving it as needed or add
more intelligence to the bypass thing) and I'm not sure at all adding
more capability to the adhoc filtering is the better direction.

So, what I wanna say is that if you can get by with the adhoc thing we
already have in place for cd/dvd, that's great; otherwise, it's not
clear at all whether expanding that adhoc filtering is a good idea.

Thanks.
