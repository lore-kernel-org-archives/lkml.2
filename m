richacl related changes to ext4 is minimal. They mostly are to call
necessary permission check functions and to map xattr to richacl
structure.

I have a patch in the full series which enable richacl on ext4 file system
based on ext4 compatibility flags. I didn't add that as a part of this
series to enable easy testing. The goal is to use tune2fs to enable
richacl and them the mount option -o acl enable richacl/posix acl
accordingly.
