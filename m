Thanks, ok it was ti which was invalid. Not tio.
ti is a pointer to dm table entry, which is vmalloc-ed.
So it means the dm table was replaced while I/O was in-flight.

dm has a machanism to prevent it: in dm_suspend(),
stop_queue() is called to stop block queue processing
and no new I/O becomes in-flight after that.
Then all in-flight I/Os are waited to be completed or requeued
(dm_wait_for_completion()).
If the wait was successful, the table can become "suspended",
i.e. ready to be replaced.

So ti should be always valid.
Hmm..
