That's why I left the MODULE_AUTHOR line in there - not sure what
else to do for that.  I'll add a comment in p9auth.txt, especially
pointing back to Ashwin's original paper.

It was dropped from staging :)  I don't particularly care to see it
go back into staging, as opposed to working out issues out of tree
(assuming they are solvable).  For one thing, as you note below,
there is the question of whether it should be a device driver at
all.

If Ashwin doesn't want to maintain it, I'll do it.  Either way.

Hmm, where?  Not in /dev on my SLES11 partition...

Well...

At first I was thinking same as you were.  So I was going to switch
to a pure syscall-based approach.  But it just turned out more
complicated.  The factotum server would call sys_grantid(), and
the target task would end up doing some huge sys_setresugid() or
else multiple syscalls using the granted id.  It just was uglier.
I think there's an experimental patchset sitting somewhere I could
point to (if I weren't embarassed :).

Another possibility would be to use netlink, but that doesn't
appear as amenable to segragation by user namespaces.  The pid
(presumably/hopefully global pid, as __u32) is available, so it
shouldn't be impossible, but a simple device with simple synchronous
read/write certainly has its appeal.  Firing off a message hoping
that at some point our credentials will be changes, less so.

Well there's nothing actually wrong with the cap_mutex.  I put in
this comment thinking I'd switch to rcu at some point, but it doesn't
seem worthwhile at the moment, by a long shot.

Right - will switch that over, assuming we don't nix the whole idea
first.

I haven't asked Ashwin, and will be happy either way.  Ashwin, did
you want to maintain it?

Really I prefer to get rid of that altogether.  Anyone who wants
to see that can use a kprobe hooked to the exit of cap_hash().

Huh, no that change already happened.
