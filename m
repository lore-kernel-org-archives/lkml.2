Actually, I think that's true only if ra_size is divisible by 10; if
not, then depth will be something *less* than ra_size*11/10, so
depth*10/ra_size will be something less than 11 (namely 10).

... and ra_size is set to 16 * min(2, numthreads/8), so I think you'll
hit this only if min(2, numthreads/8) (rounded down) is a multiple of 5?
So for example someone using a number of threads that's a power of 2
shouldn't hit this case.

So after the fix:

depth*10/nfsdstats will always be 10 in this case.  Looks good.

Thanks for finding this!
