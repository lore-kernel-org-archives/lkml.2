postgresql errors. Typically, header corruption but from the limited
visibility I've had into this via strace, what I see is zeroed pages
where there shouldn't be.

I just ran a test and got:

ERROR:  invalid page header in block 37483 of relation base/16384/16417

but that is not the only error one might get.

Yes. I took a virtual hard disk which shows up as /dev/sdb, used
cryptsetup to format it as a LUKS volume, mounted the LUKS volume,
formatted as ext4 (or whatever), mounted that, rsync'd over a blank
postgresql 'data' directory, started postgresql, became the postgres
user, and proceeded to create the db and run the sql.

I am testing both the KOTD kernels and the "vanilla" kernels - neither
of which has the dm-crypt patches (as far as I know).
