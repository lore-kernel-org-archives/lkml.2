Not so trivially. In ocfs2, the dlm allocates small blocks with GFP_NOFS.
Furthermore, in the time-sensitive recovery thread, it preallocates buffers,
what it can, at create time. That does not mean it is not affected by
memory pressure. It is. But that shows up as slower response and not
a deadlock.
