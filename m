Tomas,
We've tried something very similar to the counter idea in fw. It doesn't help because the controller thinks he's done with the request. We have a (pretty crude) counter in the driver but no timing mechanism. We could add a timer. But what's a suitable timeout value? Is 2 seconds too short, too long? Suggestions, please.
