It depends on exactly what you're doing.  In the worst case, (ping pong
reads and writes through both aliases) you have to flush and invalidate
both alias 1 alias 2 each time you access on one and then another.

Can you explain how the code works? it looks to me like you read the xdr
stuff through the vmap region then write it out directly to the pages?
*if* this is just a conversion, *and* you never need to read the new
data through the vmap alias, you might be able to get away with a
flush_dcache_page in nfs_readdir_release_array().  If the access pattern
is more complex, you'll need more stuff splashed through the loop
(including vmap invalidation/flushing).

 Is there any way you could just rewrite nfs_readdir_add_to_array() to
use the vmap address instead of doing a kmap?  That way everything will
go through a single alias and not end up with this incoherency.
