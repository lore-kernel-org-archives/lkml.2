What a horrid patch.  But given the POSIX (mis?)feature I don't see a
better way, and the feature seems desirable.  Sigh.

What sort of users would want to turn this on, and why?

Please send a patch which adds a nice comment to this field.

Perhaps shm_rmid_forced should have had bool type.

The problem is that nobody will test your feature.  So for testing
purposes, let's enable the feature by default.  I assume this:

--- a/ipc/shm.c~ipc-introduce-shm_rmid_forced-sysctl-ipc-introduce-shm_rmid_forced-sysctl-testing
+++ a/ipc/shm.c
@@ -74,7 +74,7 @@ void shm_init_ns(struct ipc_namespace *n

+	ns->shm_rmid_forced = 1;
 	ns->shm_tot = 0;
 	ipc_init_ids(&shm_ids(ns));
 }

will do that?

Just because the existing code is crappily documented doesn't mean that
we have to copy that ;)
