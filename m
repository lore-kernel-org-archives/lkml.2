I would also like to suggest that mount is the right time to change a per file 
system behaviour. We have well known paths (add the mount options to /etc/fstab) 
and sys admins understand it.

If we have to poke a file, what is the suggested mechanism for doing this? 
Another, new script or user space utility that needs to be run at mount time for 
each file system?

If we did want to deprecate the "barrier" name, I would leave it in place and 
replace it with something meaningful (at mount time!) to users like 
"data_safety" and "no_data_safety" modes :)
