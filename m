Maybe we should just fix this anyway?

I still have the patch that adds PG_stable (and changes the
wait_for_page_stable() test to use this flag instead of PG_writeback) kicking
around in my tree.  I wrote a patch to jbd that changes journal_do_submit_data
to set PG_stable, call clear_page_dirty_for_io(), and unsets the stable bit in
the end_io processing.

It seems to get rid of the checksum-after-write errors, though I'm not
convinced it's correct.  But, I'll send both patches along.

test_opt(sb, DATA_FLAGS) != EXT3_MOUNT_WRITEBACK_DATA

since I bet data=journal mode is also borken wrt PageWriteback.

I'd rather just fix ext3. :)

(or remove it, since ext4 can handle ext3)
