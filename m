More precisely, if RC10 indicates the device is under 2 TB then ignore 
the RC16 capacity.  Or maybe issue a warning if it disagrees with the 
RC10 capacity.

That seems quite likely.  I don't know the answer for any individual 
cases, however.

For the greatest safety, I suppose we could disbelieve all the fields 
in the RC16 response if the RC16 capacity disagrees with the RC10 
capacity and the RC10 capacity is under 2 TB.
