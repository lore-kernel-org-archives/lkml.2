I just arranged things such that all the fields of the same type were together
for packing purposes, but st_result_mask could easily be brought to the front
without upsetting structure packing.

This is reasonable.  I've made that change.  I've also fixed the commit message
to not mention XSTAT_REQUEST__GET_ANYWAY anymore.

What do you mean?  That's the kstat struct, not the xstat struct being set in
your excerpt.  Certainly 'inode_version' has become 'gen' in it and
'result_mask' now appears.

Doesn't it?  Where?

I'm unsure as to whether I should copy across the btime, data_version and gen
fields here.

Because it is wanted by ecryptfs_getattr:

 		stat->blocks = lower_stat.blocks;

though possibly this should be contingent on XSTAT_REQUEST_BLOCKS being set in
stat->request_mask.

It makes it easier to see that the S_ISREG is part of the if-condition and not
part of the body.
