We don't.  That was a copy-and-paste-o.

No numbers because there's no speedup (yet).  Although I do want to
inline at least the TSC implementation eventually.

The real reason is security.  Having vread be a function pointer
implies that userspace code can find that function at a fixed address,
which is a bad idea from a security POV (and I hope it's not even true
on any architecture except x86-64).  The x86-64 vsyscall is finally
cleaned up to the point that the vread functions are the only pieces
user-executable code left at a fixed address, and I want to get rid of
them as well.

The followup change (patch 5) changes vread on x86-64 to specify TSC,
HPET, or fallback to syscall, and the vDSO reads it and acts
accordingly.  This is unfortunate in that it hardcodes assumptions
about the clocksources.

The only other way I can think of to do it is to make the pointer
point into the vDSO.  That would involve making it relative to
something in the vDSO, which would IMO be messier both in terms of
computing the pointer and in terms of calling whatever it points to.


Note that the vsyscall_fn hack is rather x86-64-specific as is.
