That's not exactly what the results of a speed comparison one of your
people did said, now is it?  The results were actually not much
difference on line speeds up to GigE.

Interface re-use (or at least ABI compatibility) is the whole point,
it's what makes the solution a drop in replacement.

For a replacement, first we get the current userspace code working as
is, then you can propose modifications to make it go faster.
