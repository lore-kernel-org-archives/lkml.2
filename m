The harm of 'potential' log spoofing affecting exactly zero known 
users right now, versus the harm of obfuscating the output for a 
known space of USB devices that print in non-US characters, at 
minimum.

Erm, do you claim that it's not possible to know which characters are 
dangerous and which ones not?

This claim is silly - do you claim some 'unknown bug' in the ASCII 
printout space?

Cannot you be bothered to enumerate the known 'bad' control and 
escape characters?

You *clearly* did not consider the full utility spectrum in the first 
version of the patch so i think it's necessary due diligence on our 
part to ask you to be more thoughtful with this ...

Please enumerate the space you excluded and the reason for exclusion.

Terminals are not some unknown and unknowable space.
