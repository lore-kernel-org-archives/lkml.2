Do you really think it is that much easier?  Even if it is easier, it is 
still an ugly kludge.  It would be much better to fix the underlying 
problem rather than try to paper over it.

The same argument could have been made against the current htree 
implementation when it was added.  I think it carries just as little 
weight now as it did then.  People who care about the added performance 
the new feature provides can use it, those who don't, won't.  Eventually 
it will become ubiquitous.

Sure it will happen, but if we read one extra block 1 in 4 billion 
times, nobody is going to notice.
