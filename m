Why not just add a new posix_fadvise() command? e.g.
POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED_FS. Simpler than adding a new syscall...

That's a potential DOS vector, I think. Drop the pagecache in a hard
loop on the root fs of a busy server and watch it crawl...

You're holding an open reference to a file/dir on the fs so it can't
be unmounted from under you. Hence I don't think you need the
s_umount locking.
