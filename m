You didn't ... I checked.

So you send out deliberate flame bait and then suffer humour failure at
an ironic reply?

Well, we could go round in circles over the cryptic nature of this
indirection for ages, but I've got a wonderful target flame war to get
back to, so why don't we just cut to the chase:

The missing information is what actually needs to be done.  Fortunately,
the documentation is here:

Documentation/DocBook/genericirq.tmpl

It gives a nice overview and describes what's needed.  Basically you're
replacing generic __do_IRQ() with an internal implementation tuned to
specific handler types using the either generic library of handler
functions in kernel/irq or something more hand crafted and chip
specific.
