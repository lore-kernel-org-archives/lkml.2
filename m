Thanks for this comment. I'll check the code for problem you mentioned here.
But I was actually talking about other thing.
Currently we create pipe in gss without any checks since we assume, that pipefs 
client dir is created already.
But with approach, represented in this patch set, pipes and dirs will be created 
only when pipefs was mounted from user-space. I.e. clients with gss auth may 
already present and some callback is required for creating gss pipes.
And also this approch assumes existence of gss auth without pipe.
