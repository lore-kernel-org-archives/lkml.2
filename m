Subject: [patch,v3,repost 00/10] make I/O path allocations more numa-friendly
Date: Tue, 27 Nov 2012 11:46:28 -0500

Hi,

This patch set makes memory allocations for data structures used in
the I/O path more numa friendly by allocating them from the same numa
node as the storage device.  I've only converted a handful of drivers
at this point.  My testing is limited by the hardware I have on hand.
Using these patches, I was able to max out the bandwidth of the storage
controller when issuing I/O from any node on my 4 node system.  Without
the patch, I/O from nodes remote to the storage device would suffer a
penalty ranging from 6-12%.  Given my relatively low-end setup[1], I
wouldn't be surprised if others could show a more significant performance
advantage.

This is a repost of the last posting.  The only changes are additional
reviewed-by/acked-by tags.  I think this version is ready for inclusion.
James, would you mind taking a look?

Cheers,
Jeff

[1] LSI Megaraid SAS controller with 1GB battery-backed cache,
fronting a RAID 6 10+2.  The workload I used was tuned to not
have to hit disk.  Fio file attached.

changes from v2->v3:
- Made the numa_node Scsi_Host structure member dependent on CONFIG_NUMA
- Got rid of a GFP_ZERO I added accidentally
changes from v1->v2:
- got rid of the vfs patch, as Al pointed out some fundamental
  problems with it
- credited Bart van Assche properly
