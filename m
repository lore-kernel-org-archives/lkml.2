The current code was failing iff the last registration returns an error.
We list the nfs program before the acl program in this list, so nfsd
registration was failing iff the acl program failed, which makes no
sense whatsoever.

I think "all or none" would be cleanest.

If people start complaining that they don't want to run rpcbind/portmap
then we could give them some way of requesting that instead of just
depending on allowing the registration to fail.

For cleanup, we can just unregister everything, right?  (No harm in
possibly unregistering something who's registration just failed?)
