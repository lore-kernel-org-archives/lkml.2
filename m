Subject: [PATCH v3 00/17] vfs: add the ability to retry on ESTALE to several syscalls

This patchset is the third version of the patchset to add ESTALE
handling to several syscalls. The basic idea is to allow the client to
gracefully retry the lookup and call when a NFS server returns ESTALE.

The previous version of this patchset is here:

    http://lwn.net/Articles/496103/

When discussing my v2 patchset, Al pointed out that the problems with
audit go beyond just doing multiple getname() calls per syscall attempt.
While that is a problem, the most insidious issue is some very brittle
logic in audit_inode_child(). I believe I now have a solution to that
problem in the patchset that I posted earlier this week:

	https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/6/26/306

The above patchset should make it safe to do retries of path-based
syscalls. The main caveat when doing that is that it's important to only
call getname() once per __user string. That ensures that you don't end
up with duplicate audit_names entries per syscall. As a side benefit, it
turns out that that's more efficient on a retry, but it does mean that
we can't use the nice user_path_* helpers in many cases.

I've tried to keep this patchset pretty granular. Some of these patches
could be combined if that's desirable. I'd like to see this go into 3.6,
but it obviously needs to go in after the above-referenced set of audit
related patches is merged.
