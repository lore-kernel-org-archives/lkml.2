I can do any splitting you like. Generally, I oriented on the similarly
large work recently accepted into the kernel: DRBD. DRBD's patches were
split on per file basis. So, I did, basically, the same, only combined
some small such files into a single patch (e.g. "[PATCH 1/17]: Integration
of SCST into the Linux kernel tree" or "[PATCH 4/17]: SCST main management
files and private headers"). Making Makefile and Kconfig as a
separate patch is just a part of this approach. Unfortunately, SCST is too
big to be allowed to be sent to LKML, where the limit is 300KB, so splitting
it on separate patches and the corresponding bisecting breakage seems to be
unavoidable.

SCST overall as well the SYSFS interface are thoroughly documented in the
SCST README and SysfsRules files, so I thought it would be unnecessary
to duplicate this text in the patch description, especially considering
that the SYSFS interface is quite big, so its description is big as well.

Would it be OK if I add to the next patches' descriptions references
where to find the corresponding documentation?

This interface provides possibility for a user to configure his/her SCST
server configuration: add/delete/manage target drivers, targets, dev handlers,
virtual devices and access control to them as well as it allows to see current
SCST configuration with necessary statistical and debug info (e.g. SGV cache
statistics).

OK

This is a bit tricky. Basically, I documented it in scst.h before
struct scst_sysfs_work_item definition.

All internal SCST management is done for simplicity under scst_mutex.
It's simple, robust and worked well even under the highest load for ages.
But in 2.6.35 sysfs was improved to make lockdep to check s_active related
deadlocks and we discovered potential circular locking dependency
between scst_mutex and s_active. On some management operations lockdep triggered
output like:

It is caused by a chicken and egg problem: SCST objects, including their sysfs hierarchy
(kobjects) are created under scst_mutex, but for some of them (ACGs and their names
attributes, ACNs, are the most problematic objects) the creation is triggered from
inside the SYSFS.

I spent a LOT of time trying to rule out this problem in an acceptable manner.
Particularly, I analyzed splitting creation of SCST objects and their kobjects, so the
latter would be created outside of scst_mutex, and making a fine grain locking for
the SCST management instead of the single scst_mutex, but all the options lead to
unacceptably complicated code. So, I have chosen the use of the separate thread for all
the SYSFS management operation with scst_mutex/s_active deadlock detecting (see
scst_sysfs_queue_wait_work()) and, if the deadlock possibility detected, returning EAGAIN
asking the user space to poll completion of the command using last_sysfs_mgmt_res
attribute. It is documented in the README and scstadmin is doing that. It, definitely,
isn't a piece of beauty, but it's simple and works, so, I believe, good enough. User space,
anyway, is supposes to hide all the complexities of the direct SYSFS manipulations under
higher level management tools like scstadmin.

> Also, kobject_del() + kobject_put() == kobject_unregister().

What do you mean? I can't find kobject_unregister() in the kernel code.

Hmm, I have not found this in the CodingStyle file. I personally started doing that
after I, adding later error recovery cases in returning void functions, several times
forgot to add the corresponding empty "return" before them, hence had them erroneously
triggered. Like:

was:

void f(void)
{
...
}

new:

void f(void)
{
...

out_error:
	error recovery code and exit
}

should be:

void f(void)
{
...
	return;

out_error:
	error recovery code and exit
}

So, I'd prefer to keep those returns to save from such mistakes in future.

Thank you,
Vlad
