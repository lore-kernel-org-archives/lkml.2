Would it be too much work in the fs to mark the page dirty before you
begin altering it (and again after you finish, just in case some cleaner
noticed and initiated a write)?  Or some other flag that indicates page
under modification?  All the process controlling the writeout (which is
pretty high up in the stack) needs to know is if we triggered the check
error by altering the page while it was in flight.

I agree that a block based retry would close all the holes ... it just
doesn't look elegant to me that the fs will already be repeating the I/O
if it changed the page and so will block.
