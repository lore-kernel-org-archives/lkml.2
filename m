Hi,

Thank you for prompt reply!
Sorry that I didn't post to containers@lists.linux-foundation.org.

Yeah, I'll eventually try to keep up with the latest,
but I just want to try the one  you think it's stable first anyway.

Thank you for the information.
Actually I was trying to create checkpoint in Document/checkpints.

Now, I tried with user-cr, compiled binary in the same tag (ckpt-v19).
Creating checkpoint  looks OK and restart -v shows it Success.  nice!
However, the contents in /tmp/test.out never get further,
it remains same as when created checkpoint.

I tried  "./restart -F /cgroup/0 -v --no-pidns < ckpt.image", got Success.
cat /cgroup/0/tasks tells that there is a process.
ps shows ./test.  So, it looks restarting.

# ps axuww |grep $(cat /cgroup/0/tasks )
root      7231  0.1  0.0   1588    64 pts/0    D    16:57   0:00 ./test
root      7238  0.0  0.1   2716   660 pts/1    R+   16:57   0:00 grep 7231

under the /proc, one file descriptor opened, and it is /tmp/test.out

#  ls -l /proc/$(cat /cgroup/0/tasks)/fd
total 0
lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Mar 16 16:58 0 -> /tmp/test.out

Nhh, it's close..

I found that when I mount cgroup with -o freezer, self_checkpoint won't work.
It worked even I didn't mount the cgroup.
Is it what you expect?

Thank you again for the help!
I'm feeling better to use the latest ..
