Consider an NFS file server providing collaborative access to multiple
independently managed domains (EG: several different universities),
each with their own LDAP userid database and Kerberos services.

The common server is in its own realm and allows cross-realm
authentication to the other university realms, using the origin realm
to decide what namespace to map each user into.

If you are just doing read-only operations then you don't need any
kind of namespace persistence on the NFS server's storage.  On the
other hand, if you want to allow users to collaborate and create ACLs
then you need something dramatically more involved.

On the wire, the kerberos server would simply identify each NFSv4 ACL
entry with a particular realm ID, but in the backend it would need
some filesystem-level disambiguation (possibly the recently-proposed
RichACL features?)

Cheers,
