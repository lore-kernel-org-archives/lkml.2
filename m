Patch 7, which is the only patch that touches code under fs/fat/, only fixes
the case where the filesystem tries to modify its own metadata while writing
out the same metadata.

Patches 2 and 3, which affect only files mm/ and fs/, prevent data pages from
being modified while the same data pages are being written out.  It is not
necessary to modify any fs/fat/ code to fix the data page case, fortunately.

That said, the intent of the patch set is to prevent writes to any memory page,
regardless of type (data or metadata), while the same page is being written out.
