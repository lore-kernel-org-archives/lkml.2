  Thanks for report. Actually I was able to reproduce these messages with
data=journal mode as well when running bash_shared_mapping test. The
culprit of the problem is that block_mkwrite() as used in
ext4_page_mkwrite() marks buffers dirty and JBD2 notices this before
we clear dirty bits later in ext4_page_mkwrite() (since JBD2 doesn't use
page lock for protection when inspecting buffers). So for data=journal mode
we'll probably have to reimplement what block_page_mkwrite() does in a
slightly different manner tweaked for the needs of data=journal mode.
