I suspect that WINE would have the same need
to ship them to an NFS server as to a Windows server,
and the NFS4 protocol specification also defines these,
although I could not find the same level of detail that MS-FSA
provides (e.g. see section 2.14.10 for the detailed
description of how lock conflicts are checked) but the
semantics are probably the same.
