I actually use git to manage my quilt patch tree so that others can work
with me.  Don't confuse a scm with a patch management tool, they are two
vastly different things and have no relation to each other here.

And this sub-topic has NOTHING to do with the main issue here, so I
don't know why you are arguing over it.  Please take it elsewhere.
