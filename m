Yes using discard to avoid reading stale data might be partial solution
on some hardware. Although it has its own problems like minimum discard
range size, cache flush, slowness with some hardware and the fact that
it might not actually zero all of the data, but all of that should get
better in future I guess. Unfortunately this is definitely not a
solution for now.

I do not think this is debatable at all. It _is_ security hole no matter
what. What you're talking about is just the privilege to create such
dangerous file. After it is created, it is protected _only_ by the
application logic (and bug in the application can expose stale data to
the regular use) or file permission which is even worse since people get
this wrong all the time. So it is not like it is perfectly safe to let only
root create such file, not at all.

Moreover users will get this wrong, because they will not understand
every corner case. And when you add the "performance boost" and the
vague name of the flag (really FALLOC_FL_EXPOSE_USER_DATA would have
been much better) into the mix you'll get a disaster.

Well, then let them use xfs, since they do not have this problem, or
rather let's fix the root cause.
