Agreed on both counts, tough I'm not keen on 'bump' myself.
  got_unique_time()
because that it what we just did...  I prefer the name to reflect why the
function is called, rather than what the function is expected to do about it.
  never_use_this_timestamp_again(timestamp)
:-?

The current_fs_precise_time has been incremented with a resolution higher
than s_time_gran.  i.e. s_time_gran > 1.
I'm not really sure what we want to do about that.
Maybe we should be incrementing tv_nsec by s_time_gran as long as that is
significantly less than jiffies_to_usec(1)*1000, but I don't know what I mean
by 'significantly'.

The only values I can find for s_time_gran in current code are 1, 100, 1000
and 1000000000.
All those are either way bigger than a jiffie or significantly smaller, but
suppose a filesystem came along that chose 1000000 (i.e. millisecond
timestamps) - should we increment tv_nsec by 1000000, or not, or cross that
bridge when we come to it?

For reference:
  default is 1000000000  (this would cover ext2, ext3, reiserfs, fat, sysv, ...)
  cifs, smbfs, ntfs are 100
  udf, ceph are 1000
  rest (btrfs, ext4, gfs2, jfs, nilfs, ocfs2, xfs and virtual filesystems) are 1
