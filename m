  I agree that the patches will need a careful review because of catches
like you mention.

 I agree, maybe I've shooted too high (feel free to suggest better topic),
but we'll see what the guy comes up with. Personally, I find it more useful
to correct bad patches trying to achieve good things than spending time
shooting down trivial code rearrangements...
