No, I think that's probably a bug -- but I don't know if it's the same
bug: the symptoms are slightly different.

(Note that some hard drives in the distant past had been known to write
rubbish if powered down during a write. I don't think this has been true
for a good decade or so, though.)

True. I'm stuck with a problem that I can only currently reproduce on
physical hardware myself :( In addition to seeing if Ted's proposed
patch reduces the frequency of corruption, I'll be doing some tests this
weekend with LVM block device suspension and subsequent reboots to see
if that causes similar symptoms even in virtualization.
