Which property is robust?

I didn't say about intrinsic algorithmic problems :)
I just repeat (after Knuth et al) that B-trees with variable-length 
records don't
have any sane boundary for internal fragmentation. The common idea is 
that if we
don't want Btrfs to be in infinite development stage, then we should 
choose some
*sane* strategy (for example the paper of Ohad Rodeh) and strictly 
adhere this in
future.

Frankly, I would like to believe to such end, taking into account amount 
of my
contributions to the Btrfs project. At least to make sure I didn't do 
useless
work..

Because of top-down balancing. It doesn't like "clever" things like 
"splitting"
and "merging". Currently top-down works properly only with stupid classic
Bayer's B-trees.

I'll try to help, but I am rather pessimistic here: working out 
algorithms is
something, which doesn't like timelines..

Ok, let's violate this, but not in the detriment of utilisation:
Internal fragmentation is a horror for file systems, the enemy #1
(which is completely defeated in the last century BTW).

IMHO this is a problem, as we can not estimate number of such nodes.
Do you have any sane upper boundary for this number? I don't know such one.
Maybe I have missed something?

At the end of what? I hope you don't speak about on-line defragmentation?
Can you point me to the paper (if any)?

Thanks!
