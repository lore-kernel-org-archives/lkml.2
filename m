Linus,

please pull user namespace enhancements for v3.5-rc1 from:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace.git for-linus

The tree is against v3.4-rc1 aka dd775ae2549217d3ae09363e3edb305d0fa19928
The topmost commit is 4b06a81f1daee668fbd6de85557bfb36dd36078f

This is a course correction for the user namespace, so that we can reach
an inexpensive, maintainable, and reasonably complete implementation.

Highlights.
- Config guards make it impossible to enable the user namespace and
  code that has not been converted to be user namespace safe.

- Use of the new kuid_t type ensures the if you somehow get past the
  config guards the kernel will encounter type errors if you enable user
  namespaces and attempt to compile in code whose permission checks have
  not been updated to be user namespace safe.

- All uids from child user namespaces are mapped into the initial user
  namespace before they are processed.  Removing the need to add an
  additional check to see if the user namespace of the compared uids
  remains the same.

- With the user namespaces compiled out the performance is as good or
  better than it is today.

- For most operations absolutely nothing changes performance or
  operationally with the user namespace enabled.

- The worse case performance I could come up with was timing 1 billion
  cache cold stat operations with the user namespace code enabled.  This
  went from 156s to 164s on my laptop (or 156ns to 164ns per stat
  operation).

- (uid_t)-1 and (gid_t)-1 are reserved as an internal error value.  Most
  uid/gid setting system calls treat these value specially anyway so
  attempting to use -1 as a uid would likely cause entertaining failures
  in userspace.

- If setuid is called with a uid that can not be mapped setuid fails.  I
  have looked at sendmail, login, ssh and every other program I could
  think of that would call setuid and they all check for and handle the
  case where setuid fails.

- If stat or a similar system call is called from a context in which we
  can not map a uid we lie and return overflowuid.  The LFS experience
  suggests not lying and returning an error code might be better, but
  the historical precedent with uids is different and I can not think
  of anything that would break by lying about a uid we can't map.

- Capabilities are localized to the current user namespace making it
  safe to give the initial user in a user namespace all capabilities.

My git tree covers all of the modifications needed to convert the core
kernel and enough changes to make a system bootable to runlevel 1.
