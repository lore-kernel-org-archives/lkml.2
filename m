Do you propose to implement default as sysctl parameter?

It's no so obvious for me why we should restrict it. ;)

Currently, there is no association between rpc_pipefs and mount namespace,
so I don't see simple way to restrict number of rpc_pipefs per mount
namespace. Associating mount namespace with rpc_pipefs is not a good idea,
I think.
