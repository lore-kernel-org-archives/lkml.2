However, in one of the situations I'm thinking of, no lock is held.  All that
is being tested is whether the pointer to some RCU-protected data is either
NULL or non-NULL.  For example:

	@@ -345,7 +346,7 @@ int nfs_inode_return_delegation(struct inode *inode)
		struct nfs_delegation *delegation;
		int err = 0;

	-	if (rcu_dereference(nfsi->delegation) != NULL) {
	+	if (nfsi->delegation != NULL) {
			spin_lock(&clp->cl_lock);
			delegation = nfs_detach_delegation_locked(nfsi, NULL);
			spin_unlock(&clp->cl_lock);

No lock - RCU or spinlock - is held over the check of nfsi->delegation - which
causes lockdep to complain about an unguarded rcu_dereference().

However, the use of rcu_dereference() here is unnecessary with respect to the
interpolation (where appropriate) of a memory barrier because there is no
second memory access against which to order.

That said, the memory access is repeated inside nfs_detach_delegation_locked(),
which again was wrapped in an rcu_dereference():

	 static struct nfs_delegation *nfs_detach_delegation_locked(struct nfs_inode *nfsi, const nfs4_stateid *stateid)
	 {
	-	struct nfs_delegation *delegation = rcu_dereference(nfsi->delegation);
	+	struct nfs_delegation *delegation = nfsi->delegation;

		if (delegation == NULL)
			goto nomatch;

which was not necessary for its memory barrier interpolation properties in this
case because of the spin_lock() the caller now holds.


Your suggestion of using rcu_dereference_check() in both these places would
result in two unnecessary memory barriers on something like an Alpha CPU.


How about:

	static struct nfs_delegation *nfs_detach_delegation_locked(struct nfs_inode *nfsi, const nfs4_stateid *stateid)
	{
		struct nfs_delegation *delegation =
			rcu_locked_dereference(nfsi->delegation);
		...
	}

where rcu_locked_dereference() only does the lockdep magic and the dereference,
and does not include a memory barrier.  The documentation of such a function
would note this may only be used when the pointer is guarded by an exclusive
lock to prevent it from changing.

And then:

	int nfs_inode_return_delegation(struct inode *inode)
	{
		struct nfs_client *clp = NFS_SERVER(inode)->nfs_client;
		struct nfs_inode *nfsi = NFS_I(inode);
		struct nfs_delegation *delegation;
		int err = 0;

		if (rcu_pointer_not_null(nfsi->delegation)) {
			spin_lock(&clp->cl_lock);
			delegation = nfs_detach_delegation_locked(nfsi, NULL);
			spin_unlock(&clp->cl_lock);
			if (delegation != NULL) {
				nfs_msync_inode(inode);
				err = __nfs_inode_return_delegation(inode, delegation, 1);
			}
		}
		return err;
	}

where rcu_pointer_not_null() simply tests the value of the pointer, casting
away the sparse RCU annotation and not doing the lockdep check and not
including a barrier.  It would not return the value of the pointer, thus
preventing you from needing the barrier as a result.
