Hi Eric,

If you want to try out something that has more features than a basic
hash table, already exists and is available for you to play with, you
might want to have a look at the RCU lock-free resizable hash table.
It's initially done in userspace, but shares the same RCU semantic as
the kernel, and has chunk-based kernel-friendly index backends (thanks
to Lai Jiangshan), very useful to integrate with the kernel page
allocator.

It has the following properties that might make this container a good
fit for uid hashing:

- Real-time friendly lookups: Lookups are RCU and wait-free.
- Fast and real-time friendly updates: Use cmpxchg for update, and RCU
  to deal with ABA.
- Resize (expand/shrink) for each power of two size, performed
  concurrently with ongoing updates and lookups.
- Has add_unique (uniquify), add_replace, and also duplicate semantics.
- Provide uniqueness guarantees for RCU traversals of the hash table
  with respect to add_unique and add_replace.

So if you are looking for a fast, RT-friendly, resizable hash table to
play with, you might want to have a look at the userspace RCU
implementation, which now features this hash table:

https://lttng.org/urcu

See urcu/rculfhash.h for the API.

Best regards,

Mathieu
