Right ... I couldn't persuade anyone else to do it, so I'll probably end
up coding it.  It looks like the serial number zero check might be
bogus.  If so I'll remove it, then push the serial number acquisition
down only into the locked queuecommand of only those drivers that
actually use it (which were listed in the quoted email, and which might
have a big impetus to remove it if the use is trivial).  Then we can
begin unwinding the locking.
