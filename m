I know about the discussions regarding compatibility with existing
applications. The problem here is, that it is not only a compatibility
problem. Having atime enabled by default, may give you ENOSPC
for reasons that a normal user does not understand or expect.
As a normal user, I would think: If I never change something, why
does it then take up more space just by reading it?
