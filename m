OK, I was missing your point.  And this is what you were proposing
rcu_pointer_not_null() for.

Right now you don't.  We will need something as part of Arnd's patches to
shut sparse up, and I was hoping not to have to go through the find/fix
cycle twice.  But that turned out to be kind of pointless, since we
have burned far more time discussing than it would have taken to fix
it twice.  ;-)

But the discussion has been helpful, as I was previously just fine with
sprinkling otherwise-unneed rcu_dereference_whatever() calls thoughout
the kernel!

							Thanx, Paul
