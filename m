Just curious, what happens when you run Peter's mkdir_test() on a
local file system? Any errors returned? 

I would think removing hierarchy of directories while they are being 
accessed has to even cause local fs some type of havoc

We'll have to agree to disagree... I think any application that is 
removing hierarchies of file and directory w/out taking any 
precautionary locking is a shortcoming of the application
implementation.

How would legacy apps handle this new errno, esp if they have logic
to take care of ESTALE errors?

steved.
