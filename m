The patch above certainly seems to fix things for me. After almost 24 
hours uptime my iommu_iova looks entirely reasonable:

iommu_iova           592    885     64   59    1 : tunables  120   60    
8 : slabdata     15     15     60

We'll see in a few days' time if this resolves my entire performance 
problem, but I'm nearly 100% confident it does.

Thanks.

Chris
