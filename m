So my corrupt journal is simply the result of a user turning off the 
machine at a bad point in time? That's scary. In that scenario even the 
option data=journal wouldn't save me from harm, would it?

Funny this happens to someone who has always said that robustness is the 
most important quality of a filesystem (and who thinks data=writeback is 
madness).

Backups are good, and always too old.

Indeed the symptoms look different.

true, i normally re-create problems with vanilla kernels before 
reporting them. In this case I was cleanly sniped with no chance of 
re-play so far.
