Yes, there are. It actually helped pinpoint corruption here, 4 time it
was major corruption.

And yes, I'd like fsck more often, when they are power failures and
less often when the shutdowns are orderly...

I'm not sure of what right intervals between check are for you, but
I'd say that fsck once a year or every 100 mounts or every 10 power
failures is probably good idea for everybody...

On laptop situation is easy. Pull the plug, hit reset, wait for fsck,
plug AC back in. Done that, too :-).

Yep, it would be nice if fsck had "escape" button.

fsck lottery. :-).
