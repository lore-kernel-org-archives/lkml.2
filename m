Yes, you could use a in-mem flag (set in update, cleared in trigger) to
identify dirty inodes. The discussion on stable pages could be relevant for
the nojournal case.

Joel Becker may remember the overhead. He wrote the patch. That said we have few
differences. ocfs2 has larger (blocksized) inodes. Also, it computes ECC. The code
is in fs/ocfs2/blockcheck.c.

As in, you may want to generate ext4 specific numbers.
