So I have been running Linux 2.6.37-(.. 3.0 recently) since Jan of this year on these new hosts and I have never had so much as a kernel OOPS, with these 
patches, there were several kernel lockups/problems but the nfs/loop did 
not show up.

I've went back to the previous (non-patched) kernel, is there a less invasive
patch?
