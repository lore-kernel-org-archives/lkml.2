With '/bin/ls' it does not change at all, so I took a bigger binary
which yields to:

   homes:/home/ 8203780  9072000 9174400          403688  500000  550000

So yes, it seems to be there as well.

No.

I rebooted once, got a recovery and then the quotas were ok again (and
supposedly the used blocks as well). I assume a unmount/mount would show
the same behaviour but requires a bit of preparation to try out.

Had 2.6.37 on the server before and that was fine regarding this.
