I still prefer the capability check. I think it's much more simple from
the userspace point of view to be able to specify any file or directory
instead of being forced to retrieve the mountpoint.

However, an advantage with the approach you're proposing is that a
non-privileged user can drop the page cache of a filesystem if it has
write permission in the root of that filesystem.

mmmh.. I don't see big problems also with the interface you propose, if
you all think it's better I can implement this in the next version.

Thanks,
