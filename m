I thought the conclusion was that nobody really had any sane use case
for multiple hierarchies.  So while nobody wanted to just disable them
in fear of breaking someones usecase, individual controllers still can
only be active in a single hierarchy.  I don't see why the task
controller should now as a precedence support a level of flexibility
that is very doubtful in the first place.

I don't agree, it's a valid usecase to monitor a workload without
limiting it in any way.  I do it all the time.

And that's why I have a horrible feeling about extending the cgroup
core to do hierarchical accounting and limiting.  See below.

I do think there is a big difference between having a list of tasks
per individual cgroup to manage basic task-cgroup relationship on one
hand, and accounting and limiting the number of allowed tasks over
multi-level group hierarchies on the other.  It may seem natural on
the face of it, but it really isn't, IMO.  One is basic plumbing, the
other is applying actual semantics to a hierarchy of groups, which has
always been the domain of controllers.  It's simply a layering
violation in my eyes.

To reraise a point from my other email that was ignored: do users
actually really care about the number of tasks when they want to
prevent forkbombs?  If a task would use neither CPU nor memory, you
would not be interested in limiting the number of tasks.

Because the number of tasks is not a resource.  CPU and memory are.

So again, if we would include the memory impact of tasks properly
(structures, kernel stack pages) in the kernel memory counters which
we allow to limit, shouldn't this solve our problem?

You said in private email that you didn't like the idea because
administrators wouldn't know how big the kernel stack was and that the
number of tasks would be a more natural thing to limit.  But I think
that is actually an argument in favor of the kmem approach: the user
has no idea how much impact a task actually has resource-wise!  On the
other hand, he knows exactly how much memory and CPU his machine has
and how he wants to distribute these resources.  So why provide him
with an interface to control some number in an unknowwn unit?

You don't propose we allow limiting the number of dcache entries,
either, but rather the memory they use.

The historical limiting of number of tasks through rlimit is anything
but scientific or natural.  You essentially set it to a random value
between allowing most users to do their job and preventing things from
taking down the machine.  With proper resource accounting, which we
want to have anyway, we can do much better than that, so why shouldn't
we?
