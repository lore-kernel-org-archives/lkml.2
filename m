Yes, I'll sort of buy this ... although it's not quite that clean:
barrier methods, which are only used for filesystem above block devices
also live in the queue.

No ... that's by design ... but you don't need it if all you're doing is
unlocking the native capacity (whether on behalf of block dev ops or
queue ops).

s/properly/im\&/
