I see.

Manipulating sigmask would work in most cases but there are corner
cases (e.g. debug signals will force the mask off) and diddling with
sigmask in kernel generally isn't a good idea.

If TASK_KILLABLE is only used for killable && freezable, that probably
would be the cleanest solution but given the name and the fact that
people are in general much more aware of SIGKILL's then freezer, I
think adding such assumption is likely to cause very subtle bugs.  For
example, mem_cgroup_handle_oom() seems to assume that if it's waken
from TASK_KILLABLE either the condition it was waiting for is true or
it is dying.

If there are only a handful sites which need this type of behavior,
wouldn't something like the following work?

#define wait_event_freezekillable(wq, condition)			\
do {									\
	DEFINE_WAIT(__wait);						\
	for (;;) {							\
		prepare_to_wait(&wq, &__wait, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);	\
		if (condition || fatal_signal_pending(current))		\
			break;						\
		schedule();						\
		try_to_freeze();					\
	}								\
	finish_wait(&wq, &__wait);					\
} while (0)

Thanks.
