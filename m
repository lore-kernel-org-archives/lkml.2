That looks simpler, but I still don't understand why we need it.

I'm confused about how d_path works; I would have thought that
filesystem namespaces would have their own vfsmount trees and hence that
the (vfsmount, dentry) would be enough to specify the path.  Is the root
argument for the case of chroot?  Do we care about that?

Also, svc_export_request is called from mountd's read of
/proc/net/rpc/nfsd.export/channel.  If mountd's root is wrong, then
nothing's going to work anyway.
