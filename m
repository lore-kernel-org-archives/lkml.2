Try doing IO to multiple drives simultaneously. I had a SIL card that would corrupt data when used 
in RAID, but not single drive IO tests. I could make it fail by doing multiple dd/cp/md5sum to two 
drives simultaneously.

Do yourself a favour. Whack it on fleabay and sell it to a Windows user, then get something 
supported. Leave enough scatter around that people thinking of buying a card with that Marvell 
chipset will stay clear.
