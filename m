Machine has been solid as a rock (sans 9240-8i) for the past month with mild 
to half load. It runs several virtual machines, a nfs share, my firewall, a 
minecraft server, and some other miscellaneous stuff. Not a single hiccup.

I just got a second M1015 card in today and gave it a go. Similar issues, 
different log messages. (hand typed from picture taken of screens)

Lots of:

megasas: Waiting for 1 commands to complete

for quite a while (5-10 minutes), along with udevd trying to kill modprobe. 
Then:

megasas: moving cmd[0]:hexstringherewithcolons queue as internal
megaraid_sas: FW detected to be in fault state, restarting it...
ADP_RESET_GEN2: HostDiag=a0
megaraid_sas: FW restarted successfully,initializing next stage...
megaraid_sas: HBA recovery state machine,state 1 starting...
(sits here for a while)
megasas: Waiting for FW to come to ready state
megasas: FW now in ready state
megaraid_sas: command hexstringhere, hexstringhere detected (something?) while 
HBA reset
megasas: command hexstring scsi cmd [12]detected on the internal (something?) 
again
megasas: reset successful
scsi:0:0:0:0: megasas: RESET cmd=12 retries=0
megaraid_sas: no pending cmds after reset
megasas: reset successful
scsi:0:0:0:0: megasas: RESET cmd=12 retries=0
megaraid_sas: no pending cmds after reset
megasas: reset successful
scsi:0:0:0:0: Device offlined - not ready after error recovery
(other scsi devices are detected)
(bootup hangs here)

Eventually theres some "hung task" timeout backtraces. This is where I tried 
to kill udevd, CTRL+C didn't stop it from trying to kill modprobe, and 
ALT+SYSRQ+K caused a silent oops (keyboard leds blinking, no backtrace or OOPS 
text). If its similar to last time, eventually the kernel will outright OOPS 
without any intervention.
