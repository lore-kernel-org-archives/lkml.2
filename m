I do not think so.

The problem with "increment mtime by a nanosecond when necessary" is
that timestamps can wind up out of order.  As in:

1) Do a bunch of operations on file A
2) Do one operation on file B

Imagine each operation on A incrementing its timestamp by a nanosecond
"just because".  If all of these operations happen in less than 4 ms,
you can wind up with the timestamp on B being EARLIER than the
timestamp on A.  That is a big no-no (think "make" or anything else
relying on timestamps for relative times).

If you can prove that the last modification on B happens after the
last modification on A, then it is very bad for the mtime on B to be
earlier than the mtime on A.  I guarantee that will break things in
the real world.

As you say, high-resolution timestamps "will extend the useful
lifetime of NFSv3 by quite a bit".  They are also a good idea in
principle, IMO.  Correctness is almost always more important than
performance.
