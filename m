?

Maybe I wasn't clear: I meant having an extended stat() syscall rather than
using a bunch of getxattr()'s was the general preference.

You should also include a length.  Volume IDs may be binary rather than
NUL-terminated strings.

160, I think.

Which we currently allocate on the kernel stack, plus up to a couple of kstat
structs if something like eCryptFS is used.  Admittedly, the base xstat struct
could be kmalloc()'d instead, but why use up all that space if you don't need
it?
