So after about 32 hours of uptime theres been 36 separate events. Each spits
out similar messages as above, and each comes with a noticeable pause while
the drive is reset.

There are a number of possible reasons that I'm still having issues:
 - I managed to mess up the git checkout
 - My problem isn't related to the fix
 - The fix doesn't cover all cases of the problem it meant to fix

I'm not certain which of them it is, I'd be more inclined to think I messed up
the checkout, as I did patch something in, but the patches were completely
unrelated and shouldn't have affected the scsi or ata systems at all. At this
point I'm just grasping at straws.

In case my card is somehow different than expected, I'll paste the lspci info
for it: (AOC-SASLP-MV8)

        Kernel driver in use: mvsas

Its installed in a Phenom II X4 810 based system with a 790FX/SB750 chipset,
8G DDR3 1333 RAM, 6 1TB Seagate 7200.12 SATAII drives connected to the
card via sas->sata breakout cables, and a couple 4 drive SATA hotswap bays.
There are also two Seagate 7200.12 500G drives hooked up to the motherboard
SATA controller. The system is powered via an Antec Neopower Blue 650W PSU
which is probably only half loaded. System also has a discreet gfx card, but its
a low end, low profile, fanless card that takes up next to no power.

I'm still willing to help test any fixes for the mvsas driver on this card.

Thank you.
