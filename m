  I understand that both state transitions are currently racy. Just ext3,
ext4, reiserfs, gfs2, or btrfs do not really care about SB_FREEZE_TRANS
transition because they all grew their own synchronization mechanisms for
that. XFS is the only filesystem I know of which really relies on this
transition. That's why I originally decided to fixup SB_FREEZE_TRANS
transition only in XFS and not in VFS. But on a second thought I tend to
agree with you that VFS should provide a way to do race-free transition to
both states so that filesystems that want to use it can use it. So I'll add
a second counter for that.

  Yeah. I think ext3/4 could be converted to the generic mechanism
(although it won't be completely trivial since it uses the internal
mechanism also for other things than filesystem freezing).
