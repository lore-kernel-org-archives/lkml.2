Sure, but my point is that there is no point changing only a few and
ignoring the great majority of callers. Either fix them all, fix it
some other way (e.g. API change), or remove the code from the RAID5
function that requires it.

Right, but as things stand right now, the RAID5 code is a no-op
because nobody is setting bio->bi_rw correctly. it is effectively
dead code.

To decide whether we should take it to have meaning, data is
required to show that the RAID5 optimisation it enables is
worthwhile.  If the optimisation is not worthwhile, then the correct
thing to do is remove the optimisation in the RAID5 code and remove
the bi_rw field from the struct bvec_merge_data.

It's entirely possible that when bi_rw was added to struct
bvec_merge_data, the person who added it was mistaken that bi_rw was
set at this point in time when in fact it never has been. Hence it's
presence and reliance on it would be a bug.

That's what I'm asking - is this actually beneificial, or should it
simply be removed from struct bvec_merge_data? Data is needed to
answer that question....

Cheers,

Dave.
