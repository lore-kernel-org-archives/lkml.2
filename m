While I do remove sr_mutex aroud scsi_cd_get/put() calls, these ones
internally use another lock: sr_ref_mutex.  Always did, still do, since
neither Arnd's mechanical BKL pushdown and BKL-to-mutex conversions
patches nor my patch changed that.  This sr_ref_mutex also protects sr's
reference counting outside of the three block_device_operations methods
which I changed.

I suppose I could have mentioned right away in the changelog that the
sr driver's own reference counting serialization remains in place, via that
other mutex.

I guess sr_block_open/release are less of an issue; after all they are
still partly serialized across all sr devices (the sections which are
under the mentioned sr_ref_mutex protection).
