Er?  On server:

mount -t ext2 /dev/sdb1 /srv/nfs4
mount -t ext2 /dev/sda1 /srv/nfs4/a
mount -t ext2 /dev/sda1 /srv/nfs4/b

after that /srv/nfs4/a and /srv/nfs4/b will have the *same* inode, nevermind
the inode number.  I really mean the same filesystem mounted twice; if you
want to include inumber of mountpoint into fsid, fine, turn the above into

mount -t ext2 /dev/sdb1 /srv/nfs4
mount -t ext2 /dev/sda1 /srv/nfs4/a
mount -t ext2 /dev/sda1 /srv/nfs4/b
mount -t ext2 /dev/sda3 /srv/nfs4/a/z
mount -t ext2 /dev/sda3 /srv/nfs4/b/z

At that point you have the same fs (ext2 from sda3) mounted on /srv/nfs4/a/z
and /srv/nfs4/b/z, with the same directory inode overmounted by it in both
mountpoints.  Suppose your referral point is on /a/z/x and /b/z/x resp. and
see the question upthread...
