Not yet; I suspected that some clarification of exactly that issue was needed.
It looks to me that in general the checksum will be zero for the "flag is
enabled but no checksum has yet been provided" case, and nonzero in the "inode
is corrupt" case.  So if e2fsck sees zero it'd first ask to correct the
checksum, and if it sees nonzero it'll first ask to clear the inode.  If the
user answers no to the first question, e2fsck can then propose the second
option.

Or e2fsck could use that heuristic; which tree is the ibadness patch in?
Google shows a patch from 2008, but no recent discussion.

Something along the lines of: if the inode is not very bad, ask first to fix
the checksum and second to clear the inode; if the inode seems bad, ask first
to clear it and second to fix the checksum.

Oops, comment blooper that was a thinko on my part.  What would the @n be for?
