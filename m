I think a mail server would be an example of an application that might
do this.  I'll see if I can get a real world test case (or perhaps some
real world data) and verify that.

I agree that if we choose not to idle on write's, then this approach can
be thrown out the window.

I considered that approach, but then you run into all of the questions
about losing fairness across workloads and across groups.  I believe the
approach I've taken here is *significantly* simpler than merging and
unmerging would be.

Cheers,
