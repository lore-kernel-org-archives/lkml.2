Is this something others need?

Again, the exists vs not yet exists case for paths within indirect
autofs mounts. At the moment I can just set the flag on all dentrys in
the autofs fs and return EXDEV for non-empty directories in order to
return the dentry as a path component. OTOH if the dentry is a mount
embeded in the path and the mount fails we get a error return.

I could clear the flag on non-root parent dentrys during mkdir if this
is needed by others.
