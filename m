The above link doesn't work for me so I'm not sure.

But I guess that you are talking about the problem that
tcm_lpfc_make_lport() can accept proper hardware port addresses. We
are on the same page if so.

Doesn't sound so.

I want the driver to create necessary target directories in
/sys/kernel/config/target/ibmvscsit/ automatically.


And 'hw_ports' looks unnecessary because fc drivers already provide
such information under /sys/class/, I think.
