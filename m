The patches are quite straightforward, and you are basically throwing
useless code away...

The only think that drew my attention is that you are changing the
local_irq_save callsite to local_irq_disable. It shouldn't be a problem,
since this is never expected to be called in interrupt context.

Still... it makes me wonder if that disabled-interrupt block is still
needed? According to the changelogs, it was introduced in e7c5ec919 for
the css_tryget mechanism. But css_tryget itself will never scan
subsystems, so if we can no longer fail, we should be able to just ditch
it. Unless I am missing something
