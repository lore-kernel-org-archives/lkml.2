At this point I'm partly clueless as to what's happening.
Even the statements above turn out to be inaccurate although that is
what I observed for quite a while initially.

One thing I've found is that it's possible for __follow_mount_rcu() to
be called on a non-mountpoint autofs dentry that needs to block transit.

Another is an out of order call bug with the active list usage. It was
removing the dentry from the list before hashing it which can cause
multiple dentrys to be created for the same lookup. At this point I
don't think just changing the function call order is sufficient to fix
it. I tried to remove the active list code during the vfs-automount
development but found I couldn't always drop dentrys when I needed to
for error cases. I didn't pursue that because I had something else that
was working fine and seemed to play well with the VFS.

There is also the expire. It uses reference counts to establish
busyness, which is mostly fine, except that's also used to avoid
attempting to expire a tree that has a process walking somewhere within
it. Which more or less says that I need to drop out of rcu-walk for any
dentry that is not already being expired (or checked).

I also have a sick feeling that dentrys may become negative at any point
after __d_lookup_rcu() .....

Nope, I'd need to build a kernel specifically for that. I'm not sure how
useful that would be though since the test is specifically meant to
expose problems with multiple concurrent processes accessing an
automount tree. I don't see any problem running the Connectathon tests
which is essentially one automount and one client process.
