So what I recommend for server class machines is to either turn off
the automatic fsck's (it's the default, but it's documented and there
are supported ways of turning it off --- that's hardly developers
"ramming" it down user's throats), or more preferably, to use LVM, and
then use a snapshot and running fsck on the snapshot.

You can do this with ext3/ext4 today, now.  Just take a look at
e2croncheck in the contrib directory of e2fsprogs.  Changing it to not
do this when on battery power is a trivial exercise.

Hmm, why are you running on battery so often?  I make a point of
running connected to the AC mains whenever possible, because a LiOn
battery only has about 200 full-cycle charge/discharges in it, and
given the cost of LiOn batteries, basically each charge/discharge
cycle costs a dollar each.  So I only run on batteries when I
absolutely have to, and in practice it's rare that I dip below 30% or
so.

So e2fsck would fix the cross-linking.  We do need to have some better
tools to do forced rewrite of sectors that have gone bad in a HDD.  It
can be done by using badblocks -n, but translating the sector number
emitted by the device driver (which for some drivers is relative to
the beginning of the partition, and for others is relative to the
beginning of the disk).  It is possible to run badblocks -w on the
whole disk, of course, but it's better to just run it on the specific
block in question.

Well, it actually is a problem.  And there may be other problems
hiding that you're not aware of.  Running "badblocks -b 4096 -n" may
discover other blocks that have failed, and you can then decide
whether you want to let fsck fix things up.  If you don't, though,
it's probably not fair to blame ext3 or e2fsck for any future
failures (not that it's likely to stop you :-).
