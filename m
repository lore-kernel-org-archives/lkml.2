It only makes things slower if we rewrite a region in a file that
is currently undergoing writeback.  I'd be interested to know about
real life applications doing that, and if they really are badly affect
we should help them to work around that in userspace, e.g. by adding
a fadvice will rewrite call that might be used to never write back
that regions without an explicit fsync call.
