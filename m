It depends, we might also argue that for larger inline extents like this
we are better off with much larger leaves or with using max_inline=0
instead.

Yes.  Both Edward and I have worked on the reiserfs sources where inline
extents were split during balancing.  It made for a few surprises in the
file read/write code.  They aren't impossible by any means, but I wanted
to avoid them.
