Correct.  If the system is over its background limit then the previous
cgroup-unaware background writeback occurs.  I think of the system
limits as those of the root cgroup.  If the system is over the global
limit than all cgroups are eligible for writeback.  In this situation
the current code does not distinguish between cgroups over or under
their dirty background limit.

It might make more sense to reverse the order of the checks in the
proposed over_bground_thresh(): the new version would first check if any
memcg are over limit; assuming none are over limit, then check global
limits.  Assuming that the system is over its background limit and some
cgroups are also over their limits, then the over limit cgroups would
first be written possibly getting the system below its limit.  Does this
address your concern?

Note: mem_cgroup_balance_dirty_pages() (patch 10/12) will perform
foreground writeback when a memcg is above its dirty limit.  This would
offer CFQ multiple tasks issuing IO.

I will collect some performance data measuring the cost of scanning.
