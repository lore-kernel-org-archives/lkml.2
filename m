No, it doesn't really make much sense either.  But what I've slowly
started doing is to phase out write_inode_now.  For the cases where
we really only want to write the inode we should use
sync_inode_metadata.  That only leaves two others callsers:

 - iput_final for a filesystem during unmount.  This should be caught
   by the need to call ->sync_fs rule you mentioned above, but needs
   a closer audit.
 - nfsd.  Any filesystem that cares should just use the commit_metadata
   export operations, which is a subsystem of ->fsync as it only need
   to guarantee that metadata is on disk, but not actually any file
   data - so no cache flush mess as in a real fsync implementation.
