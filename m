I really don't think it makes sense. Ideally, I really think the driver
should be able to override the PCI layer reset interface in sysfs. If a driver
is loaded, the driver owns all the state of that device and resetting it without
informing the driver is just nasty. Additionally, many devices may have
much more complex logic to performing a reset than what PCI defines. With
ipr, for example, it needs to get a shutdown command issued to it prior to the
reset if at all possible so that the firmware quiesces any I/O it is performing.
It also needs additional communication prior to resetting the chip to ensure
the firmware is not modifying its persistent error log on the adapter's flash,
since resetting the card while the flash segment is being updated will cause
the adapter to lose the persistent error log. Post reset, ipr has a bunch
of work to do to get the firmware back up and running to a state where it
can handle I/O again.

Different ipr chips also have different requirements as to what
reset mechanisms defined by PCI actually work. Some chips require BIST to be
run via PCI config space, while others require a PCI warm reset, otherwise
the card ends up in an unusable state.

So, here is my proposal to resolve this particular issue. Add a reset function
to the pci_driver struct which would allow drivers to override the default reset
action. Drivers that can tolerate the existing reset mechanism can simply point
to a generic PCI function to perform the reset. Drivers which can't handle their
device getting reset, will simply not have a reset function defined. In this case,
anyone attempting to issue a reset via sysfs will get an error. If a driver
is not loaded, then we can perform the default reset method and fix any device
specific oddities with quirks.

I like keeping pci_block_user_cfg_access a non blocking interface. If it can
return a failure due to some other caller, it should be easy enough to modify
the ipr driver to wait for access to get unblocked before resetting the adapter.

Thanks,

Brian
