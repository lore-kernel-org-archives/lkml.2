I'm dubious about this patch: certainly you have not fully justified it.

I speak from experience: I did *exactly* the same at "bypass" when
I introduced our mem_cgroup_reset_page(), which corresponds to your
mem_cgroup_reset_owner(); it seemed right to me that a successful
(return 0) call to try_charge() should provide a good *ptr.

But others (Ying and Greg) pointed out that it changes the semantics
of __mem_cgroup_try_charge() in this case, so you need to justify the
change to all those places which do something like "if (ret || !memcg)"
after calling it.  Perhaps it is a good change everywhere, but that's
not obvious, so we chose caution.

Doesn't it lead to bypass pages being marked as charged to root, so
they don't get charged to the right owner next time they're touched?

In our internal kernel, I restored "bypass" to set *ptr = NULL as
before, but routed those callers that need it to continue on to
__mem_cgroup_commit_charge() when it's NULL, and let that do a
quick little mem_cgroup_reset_page() to root_mem_cgroup for this.

But I was growing tired of mem_cgroup_reset_page() when I prepared
the rollup I posted two weeks ago, it adds overhead where we don't
want it, so I found a way to avoid it completely.

What you're doing with mem_cgroup_reset_owner() seems reasonable to
me as a phase to go through (though there's probably more callsites
to be found - sorry to be unhelpfully mysterious about that, but
just because per-memcg-lru-locking needed them doesn't imply that
your patchset needs them), but I expect to (offer a patch to) remove
it later.

I am intending to rebase upon your patches, or at least the ones
which akpm has already taken in (I've not studied the pcg flag ones,
more noise than I want at the moment).  I'm waiting for those to
appear in a linux-next, disappointed that they weren't in today's.

(But I'm afraid my patches will then clash with Mel's new lru work.)

I have been running successfully on several machines with an
approximation to what I expect linux-next to be when it has your
patches in.  Ran very stably on two, but one hangs in reclaim after
a few hours, that's high on my list to investigate (you made no
change to vmscan.c, maybe the problem comes from Hannes's earlier
patches, but I hadn't noticed it with those alone).
