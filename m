ug, I didn't even notice this. Ignore my last email :-p

/me needs to wake-up a bit more.

I totally agree. Modifying the 'node' pointer is just asking for issues.
Yes that is error prone, but not due to the double loop. It's due to the
modifying of the node pointer that is used internally by the loop
counter. Don't do that :-)

I agree, the double loop itself is not error prone. If you are modifying
'node' you had better know what the hell you are doing.

Actually, it may be something that is legitimate. That is, if you want
to skip to the next bucket, just set node to NULL and do the break (as
Josh had done). This would break if the macro loop changed later on, but
hey, like I said, it's error prone ;-) If you really want to do that,
then hand coding the double loop would be a better bet. IOW, don't use
the macro loop.
