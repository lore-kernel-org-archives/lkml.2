it is big, but it is mostly bit testing. So the goal here is to avoid a
function call at all costs, this being a fast path.

I believe so. I remember I discussed this in the past with David
Rientjes and he advised me to test for both.

Not necessarily. Same thing as above. We want to avoid function calls in
those sites.
