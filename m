No, I don't have a bootable 32bit installation on this system. I've tested it 
now with a 32bit system by dumping the whole filesystem to an external drive 
and mounting this to a 32bit system. The result was the same.

The affected files were written by different kernels. I think at least 2.6.34, 
2.6.35-rc3 and 2.6.35-rc4 should be involved, perhaps 2.6.33 too. I'll try to 
figure it out more exactly.
