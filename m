Here I assume that you are talking about the target task.

Yes but proc inode which are created on the fly can also be released by
the reader before the target exits, so do we want to walk the node list
each time release is called by the reader ?

The current implementation tries to track target, but as noted in the
other thread we can just track the reader and in this case we do not need
atomic for task_struct nor for the proc_file_private, a simple u64
comparison will do the job

But perhaps what you propose is better, I'll try to think more about it.

IMO the proposed patch do not suffer from this race if we do the propre
permission checks just after setting the exec_id at open, or do permission
checks and then check exec_id at read. And here I'm talking about target
tracking. If we just check reader (current) then I assume that there are no
room for races.
