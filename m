Does this actually change the NFS version in use for /mnt/home, or does the client recognize that this is the same server and export as an existing mount point, and share the cache and mount options?

If the mount options are the same, this is equivalent to

# mount -o v3 localhost:/home /mnt/home
# mount -o v3 localhost:/home /mnt/home

And both mount requests should succeed.

Assuming localhost is fec0::2:5652:ff:fe20:8459, this test allows you to mount the same server by an IPv4 and an IPv6 address onto the same local directory.  Why then does 744657's test case fail?
