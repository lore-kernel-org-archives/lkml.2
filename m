Hi Lukas,

First of all, thank you for being strict with me.
I admit to having lousy marketing skills...

The market I am targeting are the sys admins who
are very cautious about their 'data' and are reluctant
therefor to migrate from ext3 to ext4, not to speak of
btrfs.

To this market I say, you can have snapshots of your
'data' on ext4 without risking the proven stability of ext4.
The snapshots of the 'data' are not guarantied to be as
stable (being a new feature), but because the snapshots
are second to 'data' in ext4 snapshots, corrupted snapshots
will not risk the 'data'.

During 1 year of next3 in production systems, we found bugs.
But none of the bugs corrupted 'data'. All of the bugs which
caused file system to contain errors, the errors were restricted
to snapshot files and in those worst cases, we could always
go to emergency plan B (plan A being fsck -p) and run fsck -x
which always solved the problem.

The customer was always consulted before resorting to 'plan B'
and was given the chance to copy out 'data' from the snapshots
(it was always possible) before we discard them.

Needless to say, the said bugs were fixed and ext4 snapshots
will enjoy the stability of next3 and the 'fail safe' nature of the
solution, which was proven several times on the field.

That's not really OK. I should have posted the results
and analysis on my wiki (the results are there).

Not that I know of.
I can explain why random write onesnap is faster than nosnap
and why 1snappermin is faster than onesnap, but I am not
sure about nosnap vs. plain ext4.

Only the 1snappermin is slower.
I suspect it has to do with the fs freezes, but I admin I have not
looked into it.

The name onesnap is misleading. It should have been
existingsnaps.
The important factor is whether or not snapshots are taken during the test.
In the 1snappermin case, postmark is the only test that exposes the
weak spot of ext4 snapshots performance - deletes/truncates.
create file+delete file with existing snapshots has no overhead (no COW).
create file+take snapshot+delete file has the overhead of moving the
deleted blocks to snapshot.
With regards to speed up of onesnap, postmark is randomizing the file
creates/write so it may be a similar effect to random write.
I did not investigate this.

Well, if you come to understand the difference between fs level an dm
level snapshots, you will see why i am rejecting dm-multisnap
(performance wise only!).

Anyway #1: I have already answered this questions 2 years ago and I
think the answers are still valid both for LVM and btrfs:
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/next3/index.php?title=FAQ#Why_use_Next3_snapshots_and_not_LVM_snapshots.3F

Anyway #2: I need to give you some numbers ;-)

Your analysis of my motives is correct :-)
The use of the term 'better way' I reject.
I think that ext4/btrfs/LVM snapshots are apples and oranges and hamburgers.
The question of whether the world needs ext4 snapshots is
perfectly valid, but going back to the food analogy, I think it's
a case of "the proof of the pudding is in the eating".
I have no doubt that if ext4 snapshots are merged, many people will use it.
And I think that is a good enough (if not the best)
reason for inclusion.

Yes, I understand. As evidence, I posted the "core patches"
to get them reviewed for "safely" and "stability" rather than
"functionality". (and that didn't work out well, but I understand that as well).

What can I say, I understand why it looks bad, but is 64bit code
upstream and stable? Hell no! e2fsprogs 64bit is not out yet!
There is no reason to call it 'format change'.
It's going to be a new format used only for 64bit fs, which are not
even out there yet. And when they are finally out there, they won't
have
snapshots until the new format is implemented.

And more important, say I do implement a new 48bit logical
offsets file format, so my employer can provide snapshots on
>16TB volumes in future releases.
I will not recommend my employer to use this format on <16TB volumes,
because there is nothing wrong with staying with the simple and well
tested indirect mapped snapshot format in future releases.

Thanks for your time and patience,
Amir.
