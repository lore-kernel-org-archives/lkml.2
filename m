Great to hear that.

And when it comes to retrying, the next problem is who controls it.
I don't think it's good to duplicate retry logic in multipath and
underlying device like SCSI (i.e. sd retries 5 times).
So perhaps we need a way to disable (or limit) retries in underlying
device at least.

It improves but still they look like critical errors
even if multipath saves them.

When I see this:

  end_request: target error, dev sda, sector XXXXX

I can't tell whether it's a real error visible to user space
or it's just recoverred by multipath retry/failover afterwards.

Thank you. I'm looking for that.
