Uhhh, no...EKEYEXPIRED was never passed to userland. The patchset that
added EKEYEXPIRED returns in this codepath also added the code to make
it hang. 

This not a bug, or at least it's intentional behavior. When a krb5
ticket expires, we *want* the process to hang. Otherwise, people with
long running jobs will often find that their jobs error out
inexplicably when their ticket expires.

The patches that introduced this behavior went into 2.6.34. See the
commits around 2c64348 (and some preceding ones in the rpc layer).

If you want to fix this use case, you'll need to come up with a scheme
that doesn't regress this behavior. I think that you'll really need to
ensure that whatever process you expect to re-fetch your TGT is not
dependent on accessing kerberized nfs mounts. That really seems like an
untenable chicken and egg situation.
