That sounds like the sort of direction I was imagining.  
I note however that vfat uses intents in a way that would not be addressed by
a '->do_last' method.  It wants to invalidate negative dentries in
d_revalidate if they are the target of a rename (or another create), and
presumably rename wouldn't use ->do_last?  Or maybe it would, but with a NULL
file ??

I tried cloning
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs-2.6.git
and couldn't find anything in the 'untested' branch.  Did I look in the wrong
place? Is there some work-in-progress I can explore?

Thanks,
