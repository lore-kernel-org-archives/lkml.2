No. You want to keep up with the thread. Ted's first educated guess is
not always guaranteed to be correct (though this is rare).

That's an interesting failure, but looks slightly different to what I
saw. No bad directory entries, no aborted journals: a replayed journal
and subsequent corruption. Still damaged though, and after a journal
abort I'm not surprised you had problems!

I relearned this week that backups are good.

I'm seeing it on almost every reboot.

Hm, this provides possible evidence that the problem does indeed extend
into 3.5.x.

It's hard to reason about a kernel that's had *that* massive lump of
binary junk applied to it, alas. This may or may not be the same
problem: it has some common features with what I see, but not all.
