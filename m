Heh, yes, ext4 uses a fairly simple crc16 and the inodes are (most likely) not
block sized.

Ok, I ran both the mailserver ffsb profile and a quick-and-dumb test that tried
to dirty inodes as fast as it could.  On both a regular disk, an SSD, and a
loopmounted ext4 on a tmpfs I couldn't really see much of a performance
difference at all.  I'll see about giving this a try once I get the field
location and e2fsck behavior more firmly resolved, though I suspect I won't see
much gain.
