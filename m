I don't think you understand how persistent reservations work.

The first thing I'll say is I agree with Alan.  Unless you can justify
why you want to relax permissions I'm not going to do it.

But secondly, the reason we're so up in arms about SCSI-3 PR is that
there's a feature called reservation by transport ID.  This is used to
reserve multipath devices when one of the paths is down.  Effectively it
allows a PR-OUT command to set a reservation on any LUN with access only
to one of them.  It's definitely a hack in the SCSI standard, but it's
not one that can be controlled by a unix like permission model.  Write
access to *any* LUN allows you to reserve *all* luns.
