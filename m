FWIW I had a similar idea quite some time ago and implemented checksums for
superblocks and inodes. I never posted it because I didn't get around
to write the e2fsprogs support and do a lot of performance testing. 
There was one result that showed a slow down in quick tests, but 
I suspect it was a fluke and probably needs to be redone. In other
tests it was neutral.

Anyways here's the old patch if anyone is interested (against a ~.35ish kernel)
I can forward port it if there's interest.

IMHO it's a good idea but it should be done for the super blocks too
(and ideally for all objects, although unfortunately that breaks 
the disk format)

The locking for stable buffers is still something that needs to be
double checked.

commit 8ece10cfa4b148075dbb93ca65855a7e2aad7b07
Author: Andi Kleen <ak@linux.intel.com>

    EXT4: Add checksums to the super block and the inodes
    
    Currently when a on-disk structure is corrupted ext4 usually
    detects it only by some internal inconsistency, but this can happen
    too late or give confusing error messages.
    
    One way to detect corruptions sooner is to use checksums. This
    means the file system can stop using a corrupted object ASAP, not
    follow any potentially corrupted pointers to other blocks,
    and also give a clear message on what happened.
    
    Potentially it can also be used to limit read only mounts and
    forced fscks. When the extent of a corruption can be detected
    accurately using checksums and only force errors on that
    particular object (this is right now not enabled though
    because there are still too many objects with missing checksums)
    
    There's a general trend in file systems recently to add metadata
    checksums, this just makes ext4 catch up a bit (in addition
    to the already existing transaction and block group checksums)
    
    Another advantage is that the checksum can also check for misplaced
    writes (by including the intended block location) and objects
    left over from before mkfs (by including the file system UUID).
    
    Adding checksums to all metadata in ext4 would likely need some
    incompatible format changes, but it's relatively straight-forward to add
    them to inodes and the super block at least. This patch-kit does this.
    
    Again it only handles some meta-data objects. This is not a full
    user-data checksumming feature or not even a "all metadata objects"
    feature.
    
    I didn't do a lot of research into different CRC functions, but simply
    used the same one as btrfs and iSCSI (crc32c).  ocfs2 uses ECCs
    that have some self-correcting ability, but that seemed overkill to me.
    The standard CRC has the advantage that the CRC is accelerated by hardware
    instructions on newer Intel CPUs and possibly on other platforms too.
    The CRC32C function is also hard coded, although in theory it could be made
    configurable per file system. But since that would lead to a multitude of
    incompatible formats I decided to simply hard code for now.
    
    Right now there is no e2fsprogs support, so fsck doesn't know about CRCs.
    
    For now the checksums can be enabled with a simple shell script
    (which is just a wrapper around debugfs):
    
    wget ftp://firstfloor.org/pub/ak/shell/e2checksum
    chmod +x e2checksum
    
    To enable:
    
    ./e2checksum /dev/device enable
    
    To disable:
    
    ./e2checksum /dev/device disable
    
    This works with the current ext4 e2fsprogs without any changes.
    
    The kernel will automatically add checksums to the file system when the
    feature is turned on, as the inodes are rewritten.
    
    WARNING: Note there is no fsck support currently, so before you run fsck better
    disable the checksums. After disabling/changing/reenabling
    you may also need to mount with ignore_crc until the checksums
    are fixed up again.
    
    The checksums are implemented as a read-only compat feature: this means
    the a file system with checksums enabled can be read by a kernel that
    does not know about checksums, but not written. Of course you can turn
    off the flag again to make the file system write compatible again (but
    that will put the checksums into a inconsistent state) or use the
    ignore_crc mount option.
    
    WARNING: the in-kernel upgrader relies on the checksum fields being
    zero when checksums are enabled. When you turn on the feature, use the
    file system, turn it off again, use it again and turn it on again the
    checksums will be in a inconsistent state. Right now this can be
    fixed by mounting with -o ignore_crc and then doing a find | xargs touch
    on the file system.
    
    I expect real e2fsprogs support can do that better.
    
    The code also adds some more sanity checks on inodes to distingush zeroed
    inodes from inodes with no checksums. This is currently done by enforcing
    that a/m/ctime are not zero. If there are broken file systems around
    where that is not true, the sanity check can be turned off (see below)
    
    There are two new mount options:
    
    ignore_crc	       Ignore the CRCs on reading but still update them
    noinode_sanity	       Don't do new inode sanity checks
    
    The implementation is not particularly optimized: it always recomputes
    the full CRC on each inode or super block write. Some more optimizations
    would be possible in this area.
    
    BENCHMARKS
    
    I ran kernelbench and it didn't show any significant difference between
    the run with checksums and the run without.
    
    I also tried timing fsstress from XFS/LTP, and it gave a 35% slowdown
    on a disk and 5% slow down on the ramdisk for the system time
    during the test.  However I'm a bit suspicious of these results.
    This was on a core 2.
    
    I also tested on a Nehalem system which has CRC acceleration instructions
    in the CPU.
    
    Anyone has a better inode metadata intensive benchmark to run?
    
    This gobbled up the last mount flag bits, but there are still some unused
    holes in the middle.
    
    The patch is definitely still experimental and needs more testing and
    review and e2fsprogs support. In particular I would appreciate review
    of my bh locking scheme.
    
    Also ext4_abort() now takes the super lock, which implies that the callers
    shouldn't.  I think I checked all callers that it's safe, but double checking
    that would be good.
    
    Opens:
    - e2fsprogs support. In this case the zero crc hack could be removed from
    the super block code at least.
    - Right now checksum numbers by default lead to a read-only file system remount
    and are also logged as "IO error". This could be made more gentle, because
    a checksum catches problems early enough that continuation might be possible.
    - Incremental checksumming
    - Checksums for extents and directories
    - In ignore_crc mode the checksums are only rewritten when the inode is somehow
    dirtied otherwise. Do this implicitely? Might be better to move this to e2fsprogs
