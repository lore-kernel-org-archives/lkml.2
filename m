The test program runs and expects many, many ENOENTS to be returned.  It just doesn't expect ESTALE to be returned.  It doesn't see ESTALE from local file systems.

To answer a question asked earlier -- the test program does not mimic any particular application behavior, except in the extreme.  It is designed to create as stressful a situation as might be ever seen.

Has anyone explained why the full solution won't work from a technical viewpoint?

	Thanx...

Just curious, what happens when you run Peter's mkdir_test() on a local file system? Any errors returned? 

I would think removing hierarchy of directories while they are being accessed has to even cause local fs some type of havoc

We'll have to agree to disagree... I think any application that is removing hierarchies of file and directory w/out taking any precautionary locking is a shortcoming of the application implementation.

How would legacy apps handle this new errno, esp if they have logic to take care of ESTALE errors?

steved.
