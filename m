Not true.  The vast majority of USB mass storage devices adhere to no SCSI
or T10 specification at all.  The official definition of the "Transparent
SCSI" operating mode of the USB Mass Storage Class is "that which
microsoft/sun/other major vendors use".  Of course, that's not written down
anywhere, but it was the intent of the committee and that is the reason why
the committee rejected all attempts by people like me to implement a
command-based compliance test.

Luben's patch changes the behavior of sd-mod, which would affect both
usb-storage and UAS.

The primary thing that UAS adds is support for USB 3.0 streams and TCQ,
which are both designed to improve performance.  I consider it likely that
the quality of device firmware will be equally poor as older devices.

That said, Luben's patch is kinda slick.  sd-mod already asks for a lot of
mode page data; it does this so that it's request matches the observed
behavior of a "popular" Redmond, WA-based OS.  Luben's patch just searches
through that data to see if it can find what it is looking for, rather than
rqeuesting a specific mode page later (which may not be supported).

That said, I still consider this somewhat risky.  We've seen devices with
grossly inaccurate data before.

But, to my thinking, as long as the devices don't see any change in the
command stream, then I think the risk has been properly mitigated.  To my
understanding, this is the case.
