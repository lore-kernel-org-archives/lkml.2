Huh.  I just checked out 2.6.32.10 and tried applying the patches a
couple different ways, and the worst I got was stuff like:

	patching file net/sunrpc/svc_xprt.c
	Hunk #1 succeeded at 711 (offset 5 lines).

Is that enough that you don't consider them clean?

In any case, I'll follow up with patches generated against 2.6.32.10.
