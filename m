No, you don't need anything like this, as rcu_dereference_check already
takes a test for alternate locking.

However, looking more closely at the code, it appears this is the
"the tree is write locked" case as described in radix-tree.h

Looking at rcupdate.h, perhaps we need a version of radix_tree_deref_slot
that uses rcu_dereference_protected?
