Your whole approach is at the wrong level.  Runtime PM between I/O 
requests for block devices should be implemented in the block layer, 
not in the SCSI layer.

It also is much more difficult than your patches would indicate.  For 
example, some USB card readers indicate a media change every time they 
resume; therefore they must not be suspended while the device file is 
open.

Another difficulty arises because some drivers need to send SCSI 
commands (such as SYNCHRONIZE CACHE) _while_ suspending or resuming.
