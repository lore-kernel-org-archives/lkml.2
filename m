+Description:
+		This folder includes the attributes related with PPI (Physical
+		Presence Interface). Only if TPM is supported by BIOS, this
+		folder makes sence. The folder path can be got by command
+		'find /sys/ -name 'pcrs''. For the detail information of PPI,
+		please refer to the PPI specification from
+		http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/

+Date:		August 2012
+Contact:	xiaoyan.zhang@intel.com
+Description:
+		This attribute shows the request for an operation to be
+		executed in the pre-OS environment. It is the only input from
+		the OS to the pre-OS environment. The request should be an
+		integer value range from 1 to 160, and 0 means no request.
+		This file can be read and written.
