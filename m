Yes, that's the "IO latency" part of the cost I mentioned above.

Seriously, we tell application writers _all the time_ that they
*must* use fsync/fdatasync to guarantee their data is on stable
storage and that they cannot rely on side-effects of filesystem or
storage specific behaviours (like ext3 ordered mode) to do that job
for them.

You're suggesting that by introducing FALLOC_FL_EXPOSE_OLD_DATA,
applications can rely on filesystem/storage specific behaviour to
guarantee data is on stable storage without the use of
fdatasync/fsync. Wht you describe is definitely storage specific,
because volatile write caches still needs the fdatasync to issue a
cache flush.

Do you see the same conflict here that I do?

Which one?
