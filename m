Will you please stop being condescending? Yes, it is nit-picking. Many
subsystems and features are being developed using patch series stored
not in git but somewhere else. Have you noticed that akpm uses his own
patch utils because git is not the best tool _for him_. Git is perfect
for Linus's and DaveM workflows (as they in turn do pulls), whereas
maintainers that prefer patch-based submissions may or may not use git,
depending on their preferences.

The choice between 2 implementations should be based purely on design and
code quality (with maintainer being reasonable and flexible enough for
additional points).
