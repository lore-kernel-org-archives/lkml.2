I'd like to use this as a vehicle to revisit how dio completions work.
Now that the generic code has a reason to defer aio completions to a
workqueue can we maybe take the whole offload to a workqueue code into
the direct-io code instead of reimplementing it in ext4 and xfs?

>From a simplicity point of view I'd love to do it unconditionally, but I
also remember that this was causing performance regressions on important
workload.  So maybe we just need a flag in the dio structure, with a way
that the get_blocks callback can communicate that it's needed.

For the specific case of O_(D)SYNC aio this would allos allow to call
->fsync from generic code instead of the filesystems having to
reimplement this.

Eww.  I'd be much happier to add a new argument than having two
different members passed as the private argument.

Maybe it's even time to bite the bullet and make struct dio public
and pass that to the end_io argument as well as generic_dio_end_io.

Any reason the check above isn't done inside of generic_dio_end_io?

Eww.  Workqueues are cheap, just create it on bootup instead of this
uglyness.  Also I don't really see any reason to make it per-fs instead
of global.
