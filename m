Taking Andi's advice, I've made the offending code use
strlcpy in place of strncpy.  More importantly, I've fixed
the same bug also in the following, nearly identical function.

-- >8 --

Two functions have this problem:
  bfa_fcs_fabric_psymb_init
  bfa_fcs_fabric_nsymb_init
They use strncpy to copy a model name of length up to 15 (16, if you
count the NUL), into a buffer of size 12 (BFA_FCS_PORT_SYMBNAME_MODEL_SZ).
However, strncpy does not always NUL-terminate, so whenever the original
model string has strlen >= 12, the following strncat reads beyond end
of the ->sym_name buffer as it attempts to find end of string.
Instead, use strlcpy, which does guarantee NUL-termination.

bfa_fcs_fabric_psymb_init(struct bfa_fcs_fabric_s *fabric)
{
	bfa_ioc_get_adapter_model(&fabric->fcs->bfa->ioc, model);
	...
	strncpy((char *)&port_cfg->sym_name, model,
		BFA_FCS_PORT_SYMBNAME_MODEL_SZ);
	strncat((char *)&port_cfg->sym_name, BFA_FCS_PORT_SYMBNAME_SEPARATOR,
		sizeof(BFA_FCS_PORT_SYMBNAME_SEPARATOR));
	...

bfa_ioc_get_adapter_model(struct bfa_ioc_s *ioc, char *model)
{
	struct bfi_ioc_attr_s	*ioc_attr;

	WARN_ON(!model);
	memset((void *)model, 0, BFA_ADAPTER_MODEL_NAME_LEN);

BFA_ADAPTER_MODEL_NAME_LEN = 16
