Looks like this is already done by the commit
e73a347b7723757bb5fb5c502814dc205a7f496d ("ext4: implement
ext4_add_groupblocks() by freeing blocks")

So we can remove ext4_{set,clear}_bit_atomic now.

> I would also encourage you to finish off this patch series by pushing up the generic ext2_{set,clear}_bit_atomic() to the few places that are currently using ext2_{set,clear}_bit_atomic() directly (looks like only fs/nilfs2/alloc.h and include/linux/ext3.h) and then removing them from the arch headers.

The difficulty of doing this is that there are two different
implementations of ext2_{set,clear}_bit_atomic (spin lock version and
test_and_{set,clear}_bit_le version).  If we can switch to one of which
on all architectures, the change is easy.  But I don't have less messy idea
to keep current behavior on all architectures.
