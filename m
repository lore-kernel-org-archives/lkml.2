FWIW, can we _ever_ get to __do_follow_link() with link->mnt != nd->path.mnt?
It's probably not what's happening here, or we would've stepped on another
BUG_ON(), but still it might be worth checking...

AFAICS, if we ever get there that way, we are fscked, so the check before
mntget() ought to replaced with BUG_ON(link->mnt != nd->path.mnt)...
