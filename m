Subject: [PATCH 1/3 v3] fs: add SEEK_HOLE and SEEK_DATA flags
Date: Thu,  5 May 2011 16:16:56 -0400
Message-Id: <1304626619-1588-1-git-send-email-josef@redhat.com>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This just gets us ready to support the SEEK_HOLE and SEEK_DATA flags.  Turns out
using fiemap in things like cp cause more problems than it solves, so lets try
and give userspace an interface that doesn't suck.  So we have

-SEEK_HOLE: move the file position to the start of the next hole greater than or
equal to the start of the suplied offset.  This is how solaris defines it, so
thats how it will work for us.  The only trick is preallocated space.  Some
filesystems will be able to safely differentiate between prealloced space and
soon to be converted prealloced space, so preallocated space could easily be
considered a hole.  At the same time some file systems will not be able to make
this differentiation and so for safety will not treat preallocated space as a
hole.

-SEEK_DATA: this is obviously a little more self-explanatory.  Again the only
ambiguity comes in with preallocated extents.  If you have an fs that can't
reliably tell that the preallocated extent is in the process of turning into a
real extent, it is correct for SEEK_DATA to park you at a preallocated extent.

In the generic case we will just assume the entire file is data and there is a
virtual hole at i_size, so SEEK_DATA will return -ENXIO unless you provide an
offset of 0 and the file size is larger than 0, and SEEK_HOLE will put you at
i_size unless pos is larger or equal to i_size.

Thanks,

v2->v3:
-Fixed i_mutex unlock screw up
-Just use inode->i_size
-Make the comments clear that we mean the next hole
