This storage controller is integrated into the chipset that will be the 
basis for upcoming workstation / server platforms.

It's a SAS (serial-attached-scsi) driver so it ties in to libsas rather 
than libata (libsas itself ties in to libata for tunnelling SATA 
protocol over SAS).  The size is attributable to the fact that all 
protocol handling for non-fast path i/o is handled by software.  There 
are still cleanups that can be made, but likely not on the on the same 
order of what we have already done.

So it's not a replacement for AHCI and AHCI will still be included in 
this chipset.  However, AHCI in this timeframe only gives you up to 
4-ports at 3Gb/s and 2-ports at 6Gb/s direct attached SATA.  This 
controller in comparison includes up to 8-ports 6Gb/s of SAS/SATA 
connectivity allowing drives to optionally be connected through an 
expander topology.

Standard workstations and servers.

Yes.  We expect the majority of platforms to populate at least some of 
the AHCI ports.  That being said populating zero AHCI ports is also a 
valid configuration option and some platform vendors may take this route.

I will note that if a user is on a platform without AHCI they will be 
missing ATAPI support as that was a feature of the isci driver that was 
deferred while the cleanup/rewrite was happening.
