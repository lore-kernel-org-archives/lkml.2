Actually it will takes 4 bytes instead of 8, since in
ext4_xattr_set_entry it uses memcpy to copy the name with namelen
initialized with strlen("data"). So "data" is fine here. As for the
calculation of max_inline_size, yes, it uses
sizeof(EXT4_XATTR_SYSTEM_DATA_NAME) which should be changed to strlen.
Thanks for the advice.

I am just worried about the cpu usage. You know, the xattr values in
ext4 has to be packed so if we change the content of an inline file
frequently(say append), the inline xattr value will be removed and added
frequently which should consume much cpu cycles. What's more, the other
xattr values has to be moved also if they are not aligned to the end of
the inode. I am not sure whether it is good for performance or not.
Another side effect is that we have to write the whole inline data every
time as a new xattr value replace every time while the current solution
just needs to memcpy the appended bytes.

Thanks
Tao
