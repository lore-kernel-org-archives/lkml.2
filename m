  Current implementation already avoids journal commit because of
fdatasync(data_fd). We remeber a transaction ID when inode metadata has
last been updated and do not force a transaction commit if it is already
committed. Thus the first fsync might force a transaction commit but second
fdatasync likely won't.
  We could actually improve the scheme to work for data as well. I wrote
a proof-of-concept patches (attached) and they nicely avoid second barrier
when doing:
echo "aaa" >file1; echo "aaa" >file2; fsync file2; fsync file1

  Ted, would you be interested in something like this?

Subject: [PATCH 1/2] block: Introduce barrier counters

Introduce a barrier counters to the block device that are incremented each time
before we send a barrier and after the barrier is completed.  Filesystems can
then use this counter to verify whether they need to issue a barrier to flush
file's data during fsync.

Subject: [PATCH 2/2] ext4: Send barriers on fsync only when needed

It isn't necessary to send a barrier to disk for fsync of file 'f'
when we already sent one after all the data of 'f' have been written.
Implement logic to detect this condition and avoid sending barrier
in this case.

We use counters of submitted and completed IO barriers for a block device.
When a page is written to the block device, we store current number of
barriers submitted in the inode. When we handle fsync, we check whether
the number of completed barriers is at least that large.
