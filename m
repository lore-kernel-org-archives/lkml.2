Being a good maintainer isn't about imposing your own dogma on others,
it's actually about reading the patches and listening to the arguments.
In this case, someone cared enough about the issues in your code to
write an alternative; that's what deserves careful consideration.

As far as the kernel is concerned, the previous code was STGT ... which
did it all in userspace.

The upside is surely support for all authentication models.  You've
still failed to say why it's wrong other than that the current out of
tree users would need a migration update to move to it.

With what you have currently it's impossible to use any other
authentication than CHAP; the infrastructure isn't even pluggable.  Plus
the control plane is tied to it, so the configfs ABI has to be changed
to add a new one ... that strikes me as the fragility here.

a change in the configfs control plane is an effective userspace ABI
change.
