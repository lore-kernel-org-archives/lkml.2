That's the precisely the reason it should still be the default. The
default settings should reflect a good user experience out of the box.
Most desktop machines are still using SATA drives. And even those that
made the leap to SSD, lots of those are still pretty sucky at high queue
depths or without read/write separation. So I'm quite sure the default
still makes a lot of sense.

Punt tuning to the server side. If you absolutely want the best
performance out of your _particular_ workload, you are expecting and
required to tune things anyway. Not just the IO scheduler, but in
general. You can't make the same requirements for the desktop.

As to kernel vs user, I just see little reason for doing it in the
kernel if we can put that policy in user space.
