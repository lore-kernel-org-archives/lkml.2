The intention of lib/uuid.c is to unify various UUID related code, and
put them in same place.  In addition to UUID generation, it provide some
other utility and may provide/collect more in the future.  So do you
think it is a good idea to put generate_rand_uuid/guid into lib/uuid.c
and maybe change the name/prototype to make it consistent with other
uuid definitions?

I think that is a good idea.  From Wikipedia, GUID is in native byte
order, while UUID is in internet byte order.
