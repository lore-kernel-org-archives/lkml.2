With -next 20110113 I'm experiencing lockups shortly after userspace
starts when booting with my root filesystem on NFS, log below.  I can
boot into /bin/sh but running real userspace triggers this very easily.
This was introduced sometime this week.

I've not bisected or otherwise investigated much yet, but I do notice
code added recently by Nick in "fs: rcu-walk for path lookup" showing up
in the backtrace so including him in the CCs.

Tail of the console log:
