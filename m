There has been a lot of interest in allowing the user to specify exactly
which fields they want the filesystem to return, and whether or not the
kernel can use cached data or not. The main use is to allow
specification of a 'stat light' that could help speed up
"readdir()+multiple stat()" type queries. At last year's Filesystem and
Storage Workshop, Mark Fasheh actually came up with an initial design:

   http://www.kerneltrap.com/mailarchive/linux-fsdevel/2009/4/7/5427274

If we're going to add in a whole new syscall for stat, should we perhaps
revisit this discussion?
