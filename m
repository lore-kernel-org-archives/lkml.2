That's true, metadata blocks are tiny. But they still cost space, and
if you run through the whole tree and access all files/directories
(e.g. with grep, rsync, diff, or whatever) a lot (probably all)
metadata blocks are affected, which can be megabytes or even
gigabytes. All those metadata blocks get cowed and unshared, and thus
use up more and more space. If you use snapshots and get to a point
where nearly no space is left, a simple search for files that one
could delete may already result in no space left. If you use hundreds
(or millions...there is no limit on snapshot counts) of snapshots, the
problem gets worse and worse.
