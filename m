Then the take 2 patch description should be updated to reflect your actual intent.  I don't think it's especially clear from your patch description why "nlmclnt_lookup_host() ... initialising the srcaddr family to AF_UNSPEC" is incorrect from an architectural standpoint.  The specifics of "fixing bad behavior" are obvious already, but the architectural problem needs to be documented.

Otherwise I'm OK with the general idea of take 2, since it passes in a NULL pointer when no special bind address is desired, as other callers of rpc_create() do.  Of course, take 2 has to pass Nick's test case too.
