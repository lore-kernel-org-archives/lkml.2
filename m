You say 2.6.32 was OK; have you tried anything else between?

And you're holding the client constant while varying only the server
version, right?

Is your network otherwise working?  (E.g. does transferring a bunch of
data from server to client using some other protocol work reliably?)

Is there anything happening on the network during these stalls?  (You
can watch the network with wireshark, for example.)

Does NFSv3 behave the same way?
