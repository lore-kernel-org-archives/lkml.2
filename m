Mikulas,

I agree that it is unfortunate that we're having to explore this level
of change to DM's flush support.  Especially given how recently your
barrier code was added.

But the work has already been done.  Rather than putting up artificial
barriers (no pun intended) it'd be great if you took the time to just
review the changes.

The patch header enumerates and describes the various changes quite
clearly.

And in fact, this first patch basically is as minimal as it gets
relative to bio-based DM's conversion to FLUSH+FUA.

Please direct your energy and talent in a positive way rather than
starting a potential flame.

Thanks,
Mike
