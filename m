As far as I can see in drivers/pci/pci-sysfs.c the numa_node sysfs 
attribute contains a single number, even for a topology like the one 
described above.

With regard to user control of the numa node: I'm not sure how to solve 
this in general. But for the ib_srp driver this should be easy to do: 
SCSI host creation is triggered by sending a login string to a sysfs 
attribute ("add_target"). It wouldn't take much time to add a parameter 
to that login string that specifies the NUMA node.

Bart.
