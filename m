Tomonori, Mike, could you comment on that, please?

Yes, but we on the target side would not be able to implement the ABI compatible interface without using library functions provided by those C files. Or, at least, it would be much harder.

So, would it be OK for you to keep those files?

I mean that if we keep those 2 files to ease our ABI compatibility effort, it would effectively mean that we would leave STGT merged. It isn't something we would create, it just would be so itself as a matter of fact. Ultimately, STGT is an user space engine. What it has in the kernel is the interface helper functions to interact with the in-kernel drivers. The simplest way to achieve the ABI compatibility is to make a backend module acting as an STGT in-target driver.

(Actually, I may not ask it, because this is the way how LIO seems[1] implemented that, which was approved on the LSF summit. I only want to make all pros and cons clear from the very beginning.)

Thanks,
Vlad

1. I wrote "seems", because currently LIO has the following code for STGT commands execution: 

int stgt_do_task(se_task_t *task)
{
	stgt_plugin_task_t *st = (stgt_plugin_task_t *) task->transport_req;
	struct Scsi_Host *sh = task->se_dev->se_hba->hba_ptr;
	struct scsi_cmnd *sc;
	int tag = MSG_SIMPLE_TAG;

	sc = scsi_host_get_command(sh, st->stgt_direction, GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!sc) {
		printk(KERN_ERR "Unable to allocate memory for struct"
			" scsi_cmnd\n");
		return PYX_TRANSPORT_LU_COMM_FAILURE;
	}

	memcpy(sc->cmnd, st->stgt_cdb, MAX_COMMAND_SIZE);
	sc->sdb.length = task->task_size;
	sc->sdb.table.sgl = task->task_sg;
	sc->tag = tag;

	BUG();
#warning FIXME: Get struct scsi_lun for scsi_tgt_queue_command()
#if 0
	err = scsi_tgt_queue_command(sc, itn_id, (struct scsi_lun *)&cmd->lun,
			cmd->tag);
	if (err) {
		printk(KERN_INFO "scsi_tgt_queue_command() failed for sc:"
			" %p\n", sc);
		scsi_host_put_command(sh, sc);
	}
#endif
	return PYX_TRANSPORT_SENT_TO_TRANSPORT;
}

which means that this pluging completely not functioning.
