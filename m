It's a bit tricky. But supposedly sysfs files are part of the ABI, no
matter how silly that may be. For these particular tunables, that means
that some parts of the ABI are only valid/there if others contain a
specific value. So I'm assuming that udev does not want to rely on that.
Now I don't know a lot about udev or udev rules, but if you could make
it depend on the value of <dev>/queue/scheduler, then it should
(supposedly) be stable and safe to rely on. It all depends on what kind
of logic you can stuff into the rules.

In any case, I'm sure that udev does not want to ship with those rules.
It would have to be a separate package. Which is fine, in my opinion.

If each path is a device, each device should get caught and matched.
