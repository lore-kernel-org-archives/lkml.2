Yes. I fscked the filesystems in 3.6.1 after rebooting: /var had a
journal replay, and the usual varieties of corruption (free space bitmap
problems and multiply-claimed blocks). (The other filesystems for which
the warning triggered had neither a journal replay nor corruption.
At least one of them, /home, likely had a few writes but not enough to
cause a journal wrap.)

I note that the warning may well *not* have triggered for /var: if the
reason it had a journal replay was simply that it was still in use by
something that hadn't died, the umount -l will have avoided doing a full
umount for that filesystem alone.

Also, the corrupted filesystem was mounted in 3.6.3 exactly once.
Multiple umounts are not necessary, but an unclean umount apparently is.
