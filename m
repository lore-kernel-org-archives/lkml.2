The support folks were able to reproduce the failure using external 
clients after about 6 hours. We're thinking that its the same symptom as 
seen in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16056. That 
backported patch b608b283a962caaa280756bc8563016a71712acf from Trond was 
just incorporated into the Ubuntu 10.04 kernel, so they'll retest to see 
if its a bona-fide fix.
