What I want is for you to tidy them up, make changelogs intelligible,
sanity  check them (like merge patches for people who submit one patch
per file), run checkpatch, make sure series compiles and integration
test them before rolling them up in a batch and sending them on (at an
interval of about one or two batches per merge window) ... in essence,
what a maintainer does.
