I was thinking more of an unsigned int argument, since it can't have more than
32 flags in it if it is also to work on 32-bit arches.

Because it gets allocated on the kernel stack.  It's already 160 bytes, and
expanding it will eat more kernel stack space.  Now, I can offset that by: (a)
embedding it in struct kstat so that we allocate less stack space in xstat()
overall, and (b) allocating kstat/xstat structs with kmalloc() rather than on
the stack in all the stat syscalls.

I was following struct stat/stat64 in arch/x86/include/asm/stat.h which do the
same.  Also, if this is going to be seen by userspace, isn't it better to use
uint32_t and suchlike?

The new information is useful for some cases.  Samba for example.  At least
two of the fields I'm adding are also made available through BSD's stat()
call, and will automatically be used for some things by autoconf magic if they
become available.

I'm still trying to get a handle on what people think will be truly useful.  I
can see things *could* be useful, particularly to GUI file managers and ls,
but not everyone is of the same opinion.

Perhaps you or others can offer answers to the following questions as these
might help:

 (1) Should I offer information that's effectively free to come by, but could
     be got through:

     (a) An extra statfs() call - such as whether a file is remote, whether
     	 it's some kernel special file?  Or what the volume label is for this
     	 file?

     (b) An extra getxattr() call - such as a file's security label.

     (c) An extra ioctl() call - such as FS_IOC_GETFLAGS.

 (2) Should I offer information that's appropriate to non-UNIX filesystems
     such as FAT, NTFS or CIFS.  Some of this may map onto other fields, such
     as FS_IOC_GETFLAGS.

 (3) Should I offer information about which results that I've returned are
     actually useful, as opposed to being fabricated on the spot?  Such as
     UID/GID in FAT or blocks in UBIFS.  This may be of use to df or a GUI.
     For instance, a GUI, seeing that UID/GID aren't useful, could ask the
     filesystem to provide information about what it considers to be valid
     ownership information.

Which would be used by even fewer people, I suspect.  However, it's certainly
an interesting idea.  I suspect it doesn't gain much over open()+fstat()
though, given that you'd still have to do most of the work of fstat() after
doing the open() thing anyway.

Also, I'm not sure how much use the atomicity is, given that the file may have
changed state between the gathering of the stat data and userspace getting to
do anything with it.

This has been suggested and denounced as stupid already.  That said, I agree
with you.

Agreed.
