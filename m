nothing is wrong with doing something smarter than what I was proposing, I 
was just intending to propose a default rule that would work (just about) 
everywhere. I was specifically trying to counter the throught hat the 
method number would/should be contant as it's passed down the layers.

The proposal had been made to have each layer do the retries for the layer 
below it, that would avoid this stacking problem, but at the cost of 
potentially doing a LOT of retries without the upper level being able to 
limit it.
