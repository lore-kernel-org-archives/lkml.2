They can only grant rights beyond the GPL providing they remove everyone
elses code. But that isn't the big issue. I wish you'd go talk to your
legal team, then you might understand the real problem here. But you
won't, so I'll hopefully be talking to them tomorrow.

"Unwilling to concede". There is nothing to concede. The GPL spells out
the rules. Also if you'd have talked to Red Hat legal you'd have
understood there are other issues here.

Can I suggest you don't make legal statements from a Red Hat address
without talking to your legal team. It's not a good idea and tends to get
people into trouble.

That's their problem. They chose not to play ball, and they are going to
have to run after us and sort their own mess out. They'll cope as they've
had a lot of practice at it.

I didn't do anything secret. How is posting publically "secret". Also I
made very sure the people who needed to see it in Red Hat did, so they
can do something about it and rein you in. It's had the right effect and
it means the right folks in Red Hat can look at the issue itself.

I spent ten years at Red Hat, I'd like them to keep that reputation which
is one of the reasons this bothers me a lot. The other being the legal
issues.

Well that's for Red Hat management and legal to determine, unless you are
also a practicing IP lawyer as well ?

This isn't tying your hands. There are two things which tie your hands
here - the GPL (intentionally) and certain properties of US law - which
I'll discuss with the appropriate Red Hat people in an appropriate forum.
You clearly are not that appropriate person.

Perhaps after that they can explain to you in the proper manner internally

- Why legal matters should be referred to lawyers for checking.
- Why your patch may raise a particularly nasty potential problem if it
  were merged
