This actually brings up an issue I've been a bit worried about: is
credentials passing for dbus adequate?  I thought that the last time
I looked through some code, there was no way in particular for upstart
to pass posix capabilities info along.  What that means is that as root
I can do

capsh --drop=(list of all capabilities) --
   reboot

and, although I don't have cap_sys_boot, I can reboot the system.  So
the only way I can prevent a container from rebooting the host is to
start it in a fresh network namespace to segrate the abstract unix
domain sockets.  But if I don't want a fresh network namespace, I'm out
of luck.
