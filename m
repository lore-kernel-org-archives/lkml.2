Before we go gung ho on this, there's no evidence that N discontiguous
ranges in one command are any better than the ranges sent N times ...
the same amount of erase overhead gets sent on SSDs.  However, we also
have to remember Thin Provisioning.  Right at the moment WRITE SAME
seems to be preferred to UNMAP ... and WRITE SAME only has a single
effective range.

Now if you're thinking of multiple contiguous ranges because of the LBA
limits to TRIM, then yes, I'm fine with that because WRITE SAME doesn't
have that problem and we can do the translation in the SATL.
