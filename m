  Hi Artem,

  thanks for your persistence with this. I wanted to give you my
Reviewed-by on this patch but I've noticed two (mostly minor) things
(see below).

  Since this was written, we seem to have grown a use of
ext4_handle_dirty_super() in fs/ext4/namei.c when adding inode to orphan
list.

  When you look at the whole __ext4_handle_dirty_super() function now, it
doesn't make much sense like this. When now == 1, we mark superblock buffer
as dirty, when now == 0, we set wtime, kbytes_written, free blocks and
inodes in the superblock buffer and then mark it dirty. Looking into all
the places calling this, I'd just drop the 'now' argument and make
everything behave as in now == 1 case.
