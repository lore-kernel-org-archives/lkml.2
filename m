Looks like the cpu timers bit landed in 2.6.11 from Roland.

Roland: Might be nice to get your thoughts on the proposed changes here.

This does seem reasonable. Any one have an objection with this?

This seems a little over-reaching. I'm not sure I see what benefit would
come from having clock_devices for the static clock_ids? The extra mutex
locking and status/null checking for the clock_device would would just
add unnecessary overhead to the performance critical clock_gettime call.

And would each cpuclock need a clock_device too?

Yes, I agree it could use some cleanup. And again, this was only a nit
with the early version of the patch, so not a huge issue right now. But
before these go upstream, we'll need to address this in some way (be it
your lookup table above or something else).
