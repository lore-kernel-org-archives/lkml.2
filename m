[adding Andrew Morton to cc]

Ted, Mingming, and I were discussing how we might get this patchset pushed
upstream on today's ext4 community call.  The ext2 patch can be dropped since
it really only was there as a proof that the generic mm/fs fixes actually
worked.  I'm unsure of the vfat maintainer's feelings on the patchset, though
he seems concerned about the performance of apps that rewrite pages frequently.
Ted seemed agreeable with the ext4 changes, though I don't know if he's
reviewed them thoroughly yet.

Ted asked for clarification as to which patches are needed to fix ext4.
Patches 1 and 5 are the two that are required for ext4, and patch 4 cleans up
some ext4 code.

Patches 1 and 2 are needed to fix xfs and nilfs.

Patches 1 and 3 (and fs-specific patches such as 6 & 7) are needed to fix the
rest.

Unfortunately, Ted and I weren't sure who (if anyone) is in charge of pushing
mm and generic fs patches upstream.  Ted suggested Andrew Morton for the mm
patches (1 & 3) and we weren't sure if Al Viro or Christoph (or someone else)
is in charge of generic vfs patches (patch #2).

So, who do I actually ask to take the mm and vfs patches?  Andrew, can I send
you patches?
