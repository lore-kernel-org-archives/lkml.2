A sysfs knob just seems wrong for this. What do you do with
filesystems or block devices that span multiple block devices,
either via md, dm, mount options (XFS - separate data, log and
realtime devices) or other means (btrfs w/ multiple devices)? 

IMO, the only sane way to control this sort of behaviour is from the
top down (i.e. from the filesystem) and not from the bottom up (i.e.
from the lowest level of block devices) because the cache flushes
are only useful to the filesystem if they are consistently
implemented from the top of the storage stack to the bottom...

Also, if you allow block devices at the bottom of the stack to be
configured to ignore flushes dynamically, we need some method to
inform the upper layers that this has happened. At minimum the
filesystem needs to log the fact that their crash/power fail
consistency guarantees have changed - there's no way I'm going to
assume that users won't do something stupid if there's a knob to
tweak....

We already have a relatively widely implemented mount option pair -
barrier/nobarrier is supported by ext3, ext4, btrfs, gfs2, xfs,
hfsplus and nilfs2 - so I'd suggest that this is the best paaaaaaah
to take for implementing a generic mount option...

Does it really matter? The next mount will set it to whatever is
necessary...

What cache does "nocacheflush" refer to? The page, inode, dentry, or
buffer caches? Or some other per filesystem cache? Perhaps the MD
stripe cache? Maybe something else? There are many different caches
in a storage system even before we consider hardware, so I think
"nocacheflush" is much more ambiguous than barrier/nobarrier...

Just my 2c worth....

Dave.
