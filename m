What was the configuration?  If dm was involved, both md and dm can
only process single flush request at a time.  Supporing multiple
flushes in flight wouldn't be too difficult.  It's just the way things
are implemented with the previous barrier implementation.  It can
definitely be improved.

Yeah, definitely sounds like REQ_FS|REQ_FLUSH request causing problem.
Can you post the kernel log?

Thanks.
