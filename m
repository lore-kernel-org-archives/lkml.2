Yes, okay.  We can say that this patch tries to implement two different 
"suspended" states, basically "low power" and "power off" (or D3hot and 
D3cold).

That's the point.  If this is to be implemented outside of the runtime
PM core, should the patch be allowed to add new fields to struct
dev_pm_info (which has to be shared among all subsystems)?

Or to put it another way, if we do add new fields to struct dev_pm_info
(like can_power_off) in order to help support multiple "suspended"  
states, shouldn't these new fields be such that they can be used by
many different subsystems rather than being special for the
full-power/no-power situation?

Likewise, should new routines like pm_runtime_allow_power_off() be
added to the runtime PM core if they are going to be used just by PCI?
