Curious...  The only caller affected by that transposition is
__follow_mount_rcu() and it would have to
	* be called from do_lookup()
	* have path->dentry pointing to a mountpoint
	* being called by the daemon.
So basically you are forcing the daemon to try and drop out of RCU mode
when it reaches a mountpoint on autofs.

It might be "kicks the thing out of RCU mode as soon as we reach into a
directory on NFS"...  Try binds down into sysfs; ->d_revalidate() will
act there as well.

Ho-hum...  I can reach RHTS, but I'd rather do that at home boxen, if
possible...  Has it been reproduced on UP boxen with SMP kernels, BTW?
