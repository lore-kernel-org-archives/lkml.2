We can, because the process that is traversing the list has to lock the
delegation and test whether it is still attached or not before it can
dereference and use the contents.

In fact, that credential pointer is only really meant to be used when we
need to return the delegation. Once we get to the nfs_free_delegation()
bit, it is no longer needed.
