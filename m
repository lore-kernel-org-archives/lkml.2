Nevermind... I was able to reproduce it, and the following patch seems
to fix it for me. Jan, can you test this as well? If so, I'll
"officially" send it to Steve and we'll get this in ASAP.

Long term, it would be better clean up the way CIFSMaxBufSize is
handled to get rid of this source of confusion...

cifs: fix MaxBufferSize advertisement in session setup

Commit c4d3396b2 failed to account for the fact that CIFSMaxBufSize does
not include the size of the header. This means that we're advertising a
size that's 0x58 bytes smaller than the client can handle.

It's also problematic in the case of a large FIND_FIRST request. That
request will specify its own MaxDataCount value, which can turn out to
be larger than the originally provided MaxBufferSize. This causes the
server to break up the response into multiple pieces when it shouldn't
and throws off the checks in check2ndT2.

Fix this by adding the amount of the header to the maxBufSize that we
advertise to the server.
