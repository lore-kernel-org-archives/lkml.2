Ok, I figured out what's wrong.

As I suspected, it's due to the partial completion.

qemu scsi driver tells that the WRITE_SAME command was successful but
somehow the command has resid. So we retry it again and again (and
leak some memory).

I don't know yet why qemu scsi driver is broken. Maybe there is a bug
in it or converting discard to FS sends broken commands to the driver.

I'll try to figure out it tomorrow.

I've put a patch to complete discard command in the all-or-nothing
manner:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tomo/linux-2.6-misc.git discard


At least, the guest kernel doesn't hang for me.
