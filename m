Intersting I figured that the ACL structure was just to get it to a
point where you could convert the NFS ACL into a posixacl and set it in
the inode. I didn't realize they were hanging around for a while.

I want to say that we had it in there at one point and then we endedup
running into a problem and having to change it. I'll ask Matt about what
problems we had sticking it in the nfs_fattr initially.
