s/address/$address/ for consistency.

How can you restore a set of processes in case they share an RW mapping
as RW in both tasks if you deny opening /proc/$pid/map_files/$address as W?

Do you have a PoC of the dumper?  At least without the restorer.  If we
see an implementation of map_files/ user we probably identify what
operation it needs and what security restrictions we have to define.
