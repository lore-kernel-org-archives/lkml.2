I kept wondering how this was useful when we've got the "cpu" subsystem
because for some reason "duty cycle" made me think this was a scheduling
policy knob. In fact, I'm pretty sure it is -- it just happens to
sometimes reduce power consumption.

Have you tried using the cpu cgroup subsystem's share to see if it can
have a similar effect?

Can you modify the cpu subsystem to enable this instead of putting it
into the cgroup freezer subsystem?

The way it oscillates between FROZEN and THAWED also bothers me. The
oscillations can be described in millisecond granularity so its possible
that reading and manipulating the freezer state from userspace could be
largely useless. Also it's not obvious what should happen when the
state file is written after the duty cycle has been set (more below).

Perhaps you could fix that up by introducting another state called
"DUTY_CYCLE" or something.

What's the overhead of using the freezer as a scheduling mechanism at
that granularity? Is it really practical?

What happens to these groups using the duty cycle during suspend and
resume? Presumably they won't be accidentally thawed so long as there
aren't races between the kernel thread(s) and suspend. I don't think
we've ever had a kernel thread that could thaw a frozen task before 
(unless it's part of the resume code itself) so I don't think this race
is covered by existing cgroup freezer code.

Overall I get the feeling this is a scheduling policy knob that doesn't
"belong" in the cgroup freezer subsystem -- though I don't have much
beyond the above questions and my personal aesthetic sense to go on :).

I think Rafael is maintaining the cgroup freezer subsystem since it makes
use of the suspend freezer so I've added him to Cc.

And presumably the applications either don't care about their power
consumption, have a bug, or are "malicious" apps -- either way assuming
cooperation from the applications and knowledgable users isn't acceptable.

Seems to me you could avoid the thread-per-cgroup overhead and the
sleep-loop code by using one timer-per-cgroup. When the timer expires
you freeze/thaw the cgroup associated with the timer, setup the next
wakeup timer, and use only one kernel thread to do it all. If you
use workqueues you might even avoid the single kernel thread.

Seems to me like that'd be a good fit for embedded devices.

Why can't val == 100? At that point it's always THAWED and no kernel
thread is necessary (just like at 0 it's always FROZEN and no kernel
thread is necessary).

Wrong indent level at least. Possible bug?
Shouldn't you disallow duty.period_pct_ms being set to 0? Then userspace
can pin a kernel thread at 100% cpu just doing freeze/thaws couldn't
it?

It's not clear what should happen when userspace writes the state
file after writing a duty_ratio_pct.

If the new state file write takes priority then:
	Writing THAWED to the state should set duty_ratio_pct to 100.
	Writing FROZEN to the state should set it to 0.

	This means existing code will get the behavior it expects.

Else, if you want duty_ratio_pct to take priority then you ought to make
the state file read-only when duty_ratio_pct is set. Otherwise existing
userspace code will happily chug along without noticing that their groups
aren't doing what they expected. This is also another good reason to
introduce a new state as suggested above (with the tenative name 
"DUTY_CYCLE").

nit: Why use a u64 for a value that can only be 0-100? (or perhaps
0-1000 if you wanted sub-1% granularity...)
