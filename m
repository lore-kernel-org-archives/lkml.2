Awesome -- thanks for testing it.

Yeah "lookupcache=none" has been the standard answer for people
suffering from ESTALE problems, but the perf hit can be quite nasty.
Avoiding that is one of the main drivers for handling ESTALE this way.

With luck, we'll see at least some of this set go in for 3.6.
