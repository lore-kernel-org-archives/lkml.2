Hello, Sasha.

If this implementation is about the common trivial case, why not just
have the usual DECLARE/DEFINE_HASHTABLE() combination?

It seems we have enough of this static usage and solving the static
case first shouldn't hinder the dynamic (!resize) case later, so,
yeah, sounds good to me.

I don't know.  If we stick to the static (or even !resize dymaic)
straight-forward hash - and we need something like that - I don't see
what the full encapsulation buys us other than a lot of trivial
wrappers.

Thanks.
