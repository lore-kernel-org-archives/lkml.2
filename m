This all seems a bit odd.  And abusive.

Yes, it would be more pleasing if direct-io was used for reading as
well.  How much more complication would it add?

If I understand correctly, on the read path we're taking a fresh page
which is destined for swapcache and then pretending that it is a
pagecache page for the purpose of the I/O?  If there already existed a
pagecache page for that file offset then we let it just sit there and
bypass it?

I'm surprised that this works at all - I guess nothing under
->readpage() goes poking around in the address_space.  For NFS, at
least!

Didn't we need to kmap the page?

I wonder if there's any point in setting PG_writeback around the IO.  I
can't think of a reason.

Confused.  Where did we set up page->index with the file offset?

More confused.  This is a swapcache page, not a pagecache page?  Why
are we running set_page_dirty() against it?

And what are we doing on the !SWP_FILE path?  Newly setting PG_dirty
against block-device-backed swapcache pages?  Why?  Where does it get
cleared again?
