Indeed, I can very much see some older LLDs making these types of
assumptions.

I think pretty bad would be an under-statement when running into either
of the above two items in ancient LLD code.

In that case, I will re-spin a v4 series that contains a legacy
host_lock held w/ SHT->queuecomand() for all of the "historically high
host_lock optimized in ->queuecommand()" LLDs that are in RFCv3, and
include the other specific ones (namely mpt/fusion and mpt2sas) that we
know are safe to drop host_lock.

Many thanks for your invaluable input on some of the non-obvious items
at play here.

Best,
