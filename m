I should probably mention times and targets.

A typical 2-core, 4G developer workstation can build our entire system 
for 1 device in about 6 - 8hrs.  We typically build each device on a 
separate server and the highest end servers we're using today, (8 - 24 
core, 24G memory), can build a single device in a little under an hour.  
Those are full build times.  A complete cycle of an incremental based 
builder, (doing nothing but bookkeeping and checking dependencies), can 
take anywhere from about 2 - 4 minutes.  And a typical single component 
update usually takes 4 - 6 minutes.

 From a developer's perspective, I'm churning out 8hr builds every 5 
minutes or so.  What snapshots provide primarily is the ability to 
discard a polluted/broken working directory while retaining the ability 
to reuse it's immediate predecessor.  It's also true that snapshots 
leave old working directories laying around where they could be examined 
or debugged, but generally that facility is rarely used because it's too 
much trouble to provide developers access to those machines.

The targets here are an openembedded based embedded linux system.
