We've actually been carrying a patch for a few years in Lustre to
increase the NR_STRIPES to 2048, and made it a configurable module
parameter.  This made a noticeable improvement to the performance
for fast systems.

The other MD RAID-5/6 patches that we have change the page submission
order to avoid the need to merge pages in the elevator so much, and a
patch to allow zero-copy IO submission if the caller marks the page for
direct IO (indicating it will not be modified until after IO completes).
This avoids a lot of overhead on fast systems.

This isn't really my area of expertise, but patches against RHEL6
could be seen at http://review.whamcloud.com/1142 if you want to
take a look.  I don't know if that code is at all relevant to what
is in 3.x today.

My experience is that on fast systems the IO scheduler just gets in the
way.  Submitting larger contiguous IOs to each disk in the first place
is far better than trying to merge small IOs again at the back end.

Cheers, Andreas
