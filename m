I am using postgres 8.4.5 on openSUSE 11.3 x86_64.
The problems were observed on both "real" hardware (thinkpad T61p) and
in virtualbox, where all current testing is taking place. The current
kernel is a "vanilla" (unpatched) kernel. I *did* set wal_sync_method
to fdatasync, however, if that is relevant. Otherwise, the pg config
is stock. With no crypt involved, I did have to iterate the tests to
observe the issue - a half-dozen times or more were necessary.
Typically, when crypt was involved, the issue would manifest much more
rapidly.
