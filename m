Sorry. Of course.

We are using AUTH_SYS for exporting read-only.

The uid (and gids) of the users accessing the filesystem (that is our 
idenitities used with SYS_AUTH) are synced. But there are other identities 
which are not. Debian i.e. allocates some system uids and gids dynamically.

With this change access to files and directories will not break but i.e. if 
you use cp as root cp will behave differently. I.e. as part of our 
installation process we once mounted a filesystem ro and cloned it with 
cp -a .... This would break.

So this basically says that idmapper will not be used for AUTH_SYS any more 
and behaves exactly as NFSv3?
