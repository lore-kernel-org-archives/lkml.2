This time began a long time ago :) that is why am I originally created
batched discard for ext4 (ext3) accessible through FITRIM ioctl. Ext4
performance with -o discard mount option goes down on the most of the
SSD's and every Thinly-provisioned storage I have a chance to benchmark.

But, for example SSD's are getting better and as time goes by we might
see devices that does not suffer terrible performance loss with discard
enabled (discard on unlink in ext4 etc...), so this "online" discard
probably still does make sense.
