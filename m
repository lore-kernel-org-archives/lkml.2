Well, I'm not involved here.. but to me it makes sense. It's just a
useful principle in software design. You don't take something that is
designed for one purpose and mis-use it. It will grow warts and
mutate, stealing flexibility. 

it's one of the reasons many software projects become
unmaintainable... nobody can change anything anymore because the
once simple design has proliferated into a nine headed monster...
