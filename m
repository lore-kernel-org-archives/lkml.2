Greetings Mike and Co,

I was doing some followup on these items for a v3 series and started
with a patch following mnc's recommendations for dropping the
scsi_error.c codes depending upon struct scsi_cmnd->serial_number:

diff --git a/drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c b/drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c
index 1de30eb..f35c127 100644
--- a/drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c
+++ b/drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c
@@ -644,11 +644,7 @@ static int __scsi_try_to_abort_cmd(struct scsi_cmnd *scmd)
  */
 static int scsi_try_to_abort_cmd(struct scsi_cmnd *scmd)
 {
-       /*
-        * scsi_done was called just after the command timed out and before
-        * we had a chance to process it. (db)
-        */
-       if (scmd->serial_number == 0)
+       if (test_bit(REQ_ATOM_COMPLETE, &scmd->request->atomic_flags))
                return SUCCESS;
        return __scsi_try_to_abort_cmd(scmd);
 }

and while building I noticed that the simple single enum REQ_ATOM_COMPLETE=0 is
currently located in block/blk.h and along with blk_mark_rq_complete() and
blk_clear_rq_complete() for setting this bit within struct request->atomic_flags.

jens, hch, tejun, and co, do you guys have a preference how this should be handled
so that scsi_try_to_abort_cmd() can use proper atomic struct request bits here and
we can get rid of this (racy..?) method of using struct scsi_cmnd->serial_number
for anything wrt to per struct scsi_cmnd context timeout handling.

Thanks!
