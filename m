Well, I expected your reaction like that. You have nothing to say, so 
(as usually) prefer to call all "handwaving" and pretend it doesn't exist.

For what is CRH here? It has no relation to the problem.

I did it at least twice and can do again if somebody ask. I'd suggest 
you to check this list archive. After that STGT and IET teams fixed that 
problem in their implementations.

It does. I'd suggest to check again, starting from scst_reserve_local().

Interesting, from which times ABORT TASK is ancient?
