Hm, I should probably remove this comment - I've talked over the
symlink implementation with a few people and it seems like it
introduces more problems than it solves.

And it solves all the readdir() problems in one go. :)

I don't know if this helps, but I just wrote support for removing ext2
whiteouts and fallthrus using tune2fs and e2fsck.  I think this does
what people want from a "visible" whiteout feature without adding more
complexity to the VFS.  It also takes away all consideration of race
conditions and dentry conversion that happens with online removal of
whiteouts and fallthrus.

What are your thoughts on what a visible whiteout/fallthru would look
like?

Thanks,
