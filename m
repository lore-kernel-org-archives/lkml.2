Ok, and we'll make it a WARN_ON_ONCE() to be nice to the kernel log.  
Although the current patchset does this with WARN_ON_ONCE(1, ...) instead, 
this serves to ensure that we aren't dependent on the page allocator's 
implementation to always loop for order < PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER in which 
case the loop in the _nofail() functions would actually do something.

On my 8GB machine, /proc/zoneinfo says the min watermark for ZONE_NORMAL 
is 5086 pages, or ~20MB.  GFP_ATOMIC would allow access to ~12MB of that, 
so perhaps we should consider this is an acceptable abuse of GFP_ATOMIC as 
a fallback behavior when GFP_NOFS or GFP_NOIO fails?
