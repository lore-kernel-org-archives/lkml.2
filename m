The log messages are for the poor admin who has to figure out why nothing is working for the user.

If you're sat at your console with nothing responding how are you going 
to see the log messages?

The "ticket expired" messages are rate limited.

The "Error: state manager failed on NFSv4 server" messages are not rate 
limited, but if you use my "rpc.gssd -e" hack they'll be written to the 
log every 5 seconds all night long.
