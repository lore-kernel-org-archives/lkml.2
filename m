I'll push the bits around and see how well it plays out in sample/test
code.  Right now, the patch never even populates the data itself - it
just returns four bytes at the requested offset on-demand, so
kernel-side it's pretty simple to do it whatever way seems the least
hideous for the ABI.

Looks like Markus just replied to this part.  I can certainly populate
a compat bit if the current approach is overconstrained, but I much
prefer to avoid making every user of seccomp need to know about the
subtleties of the calling conventions.

thanks!
