Sorry, that error arose from my lack of experience with git and its 
format-patch command. I created the patch without first committing the 
final fix to my branch.

I don't believe that proposal will solve the problem. Consider the case 
where a worker thread has just executed epoll_wait and is about to 
execute the next line of code (which will access the data associated 
with the fd receiving the event). If the deletion thread manages to call 
epoll_ctl(EPOLL_CTL_XXX) for that fd twice in a row before the worker 
thread is able to execute the next statement, then the deletion thread 
will mistakenly conclude that it is safe to destroy the data that the 
worker thread is about to access.
