Update the memory hotplug documentation to reflect the new behaviors of
memory blocks reflected in sysfs.

 4 sysfs files for memory hotplug

+All sections have their device information in sysfs.  Each section is part of
+a memory block under /sys/devices/system/memory as
 
 /sys/devices/system/memory/memoryXXX
-(XXX is section id.)
+(XXX is the section id.)
 
-Now, XXX is defined as start_address_of_section / section_size.
+Now, XXX is defined as (start_address_of_section / section_size) of the first
+section contained in the memory block.  The files 'phys_index' and
+'end_phys_index' under each directory report the beginning and end section id's
+for the memory block covered by the sysfs directory.  It is expected that all
+memory sections in this range are present and no memory holes exist in the
+range. Currently there is no way to determine if there is a memory hole, but
+the existence of one should not affect the hotplug capabilities of the memory
+block.
 
 For example, assume 1GiB section size. A device for a memory starting at
 0x100000000 is /sys/device/system/memory/memory4
 (0x100000000 / 1Gib = 4)
 This device covers address range [0x100000000 ... 0x140000000)

-'phys_device': read-only: designed to show the name of physical memory device.

-'removable'  : read-only: contains an integer value indicating
-               whether the memory section is removable or not
-               removable.  A value of 1 indicates that the memory

+                    removable.  A value of 1 indicates that the memory
+                    block is removable and a value of 0 indicates that
+                    it is not removable. A memory block is removable only if

 NOTE:
   These directories/files appear after physical memory hotplug phase.
