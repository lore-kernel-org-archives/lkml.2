I'm a fan of wiper.sh, but afaik it still cannot address a
multi-spindle LVM setup, Nor a MDraid setup.  etc.

That's because it bypasses the block stack and talks directly to the
devices.  Thus it doesn't get the benefit of all the logical to
physical sector remapping handled via the block stack.

Mark, please correct me if I'm wrong.

The LVM and MDraid setup are important to support, and only "mount -o
discard" and Lucas's FITRIM support them.

So afaik we have 3 options, each with an opportunity for improvement:

1) mount -o discard - needs kernel tuning / new hardware to be a
performance win.

2) FITRIM doesn't leverage the fact the a TRIM command can handle
multiple ranges per TRIM command payload.  I haven't seen any FITRIM
vs. wiper.sh benchmarks, so I don't know what impact that has in
practice.  Mark Lord thought that this lacking feature would cause
FITRIM to take minutes or hours with some hardware.  Especially early
generation SSDs.

3) wiper.sh does leverage the multiple ranges per TRIM command, but it
really needs a new block layer interface that would allow it to push
discard commands into the kernel via the block layer, not just down at
the physical drive layer.  The interface should accept multiple ranges
per invocation and trigger TRIM commands to the SSD that have have a
multi-range discard payload.

So it seems that for now keeping all 3 is best.  My personal hope is
that the block layer grows the ability to accept multirange discard
requests and  FITRIM is updated to leverage it.

Greg
