Umm, we already DO use the high 4 bits for a future extension in the
EXT4_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_DIRDATA feature.  The bare minimum for this is
extracted from a larger patch that allows storing extra data in the
dirent.  We use it to store a filesystem-wide 128-bit identifier into
the dirent, and it could also be used to store the high 32 bits of the
inode number in a compatible way.

I haven't pushed this upstream as I don't think anyone else is interested
in this yet, but masking off the file type is definitely simple and could
be accepted upstream.
