We had a similar problem in Lustre, where we want to ensure the integrity of some data on disk, but don't want to force an extra journal commit/barrier if there was already one since the time the write was submitted and before we need it to be on disk.

We fixed this in a similar manner but it is optimized somewhat.  In your case there is a flag on the inode in question, but you should also registered a journal commit callback after the IO has been submitted that clears the flag when the journal commits (which also implies a barrier).  This avoids a gratuitous barrier if fsync() is called on this (or any other similarly marked) inode after the journal has already issued the barrier.

The best part is that this gives "POSIXly correct" semantics for applications that are issuing the f{,data}sync() on the modified files, without penalizing them again if the journal happened to do this already in the background in aggregate.

Cheers, Andreas
