Hi Simon,

I think you are just finding yourself cycling through the VFS writeback
routines all the time because we dirty the inode for COMMIT at the same
time as we dirty a new page. Usually, we want to wait until after the
WRITE rpc call has completed, and so it was only the vfs race that
forced us to write this workaround so that we can guarantee reliable
fsync() behaviour.

My only concern at this point is to make sure that in reverting that
patch, we haven't overlooked some other fsync() bug that this patch
fixed. So far, it looks as if Dmitry's patch is sufficient to deal with
any issues that I can see.

Cheers
  Trond
