The main contention right now is wether to put the authentification
into kernel space or not.  Doing the slow path in userspace worked
out okay but not great on the initiator, but it has the potential
to become a nightmare worse than oprofile if the split ends up not
beeing perfect.

Given that we pretty well tested and working code that's used in lots
of production setups my vote is for taking it as-is unless someone can
actually show a prototype for a nicely working user/kernel split.
