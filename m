They are throttled in balance_dirty_pages() when there are too many
dirty pages.  But they are also 'throttled' in direct reclaim when
there are too many clean + dirty pages.  Wild guess: speeding up
direct reclaim allows dirty pages to be generated faster and the
writer can better saturate the BDI?

Not all filesystems ignore all VM writepage requests, either.  xfs
e.g. ignores only direct reclaim but honors requests from kswapd.
ext4 honors writepage whenever it pleases.  On those, I can imagine
the reduced writepage intereference to help.  But that can not be the
only reason as btrfs ignores writepage from the reclaim in general and
still sees improvement.
