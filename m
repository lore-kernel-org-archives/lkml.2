Yes, manifesting in two ways..

On the log-crunching box I was referencing in my reports, system time
grows proportionally with nfs_inode_cache and eventually swamps the
entire system. (See http://0x.ca/sim/ref/2.6.37/cpu3_nfs.png for an
example of it using half of the CPU after a few weeks of uptime.) The
CPU seems to come from "flush" processes, and can be seen with "top"
and "perf top" (which shows mostly spinlock contention).

The other case is much less controlled, and is a large cluster of boxes
running Apache, etc. Some event seems to case reclaim of these all at
once, and the machine effectively goes out to lunch for a few minutes
while this happens, with 30 or more "flush" processes taking 100% CPU.
We were able to set up a script to detect this immediately and pull them
from the cluster pool, and after a few minutes, everything returns to
normal.

So, the problem seems to be two problems: the massive burst of spinlock
contention from the "flush" processes for every NFS mount (and we have
about 70 of them on average), and even without the burst, the flush
processes seem to take CPU proportionally to the number of them, even
though I would expect them to just be cache at that point.

None of this was an issue in 2.6.35. I can boot it on the log crunching
box and system time is 0% after every run. On 2.6.36-38, system time
increases by about 2% every day.
