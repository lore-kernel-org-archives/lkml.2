Ok. struct mem_cgroup it is.

humm, I'll have to think about this name.
"memcg_kmem_enabled" means it is enabled in this cgroup. It is actually
used inside memcontrol.c to denote precisely that.

Now the static branch, of course, means it is globally enabled. Or as I
called here, "on".

Same reason. The slab will now have inline functions that will test
against that. The alloc functions themselves, are inside the page
allocator, and the exports can go away.

But the static branch will still be tested inside inlined functions in
the slab.

That said, for the sake of simplicity, I can make it go away here, and
add that to the right place later.

memcg_kmem_page_charge() is even better I believe, and that is what I
changed this to in my tree.

I will remove them all for now.
