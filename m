It seems so. anyway, I will do some tests for file appending to see how
much these 2 methods differs.

To be honest, with inode size = 256, we don't have much spaces left in
the inode. With current i_extra_isize 28, we have only 92 bytes left for
xattrs(4 bytes for the xattr header magic and 4 bytes for the gap
between ext4_xattr_entry and the value, 256 - 128 - 28 - 4 - 4). So
considering one ext4_xattr_entry have 16 bytes and with the miminum
namelen of 4, if we support 2 entries(one for inline data and one for a
real xattr), these will take 40 bytes. And only 52 bytes are left. I
don't think these bytes are enough for 2 xattr values. ;) So why not
take all of them(72 bytes)? As for inode size > 256, the inline data
will only takes half of the spaces left and leaves the space for other
xattrs. Does it make sense?

btw, I have no idea of what a normal acl xattr takes, but if it takes
more than 10 bytes, it will almost make the inline dir almost no use,
since we have to store dot and dotdot first and then the real file
names. Too small space isn't good but adds overhead of converting from
inline to external block.
