Not really I do mean it in this case. It is not a storage-driver code
path. Is sg a storage-driver. I was not aware anyone used it for one.

I confess my total swap ignorance. I was under the impression that
swap needs a block device. OK you could do a user-mode filesystem
over sg, under loop device. Does swap work over loop device=>ext2
for example? Or is there a way to directly swap over a filesystem
(Not block based)?

Again I confess my ignorance but I thought that copy_from_user can sleep
because of a page_fault which will invoke the memory allocation subsystem
anyway, so the out-of-memory condition will apply to copy_from_user as
well. But I don't have a clue, actually, why the copy_from_user might
sleep.

Again I never considered sg as storage-driver. It is not a block-device
and is only used from user-mode that has it's out-of-memory-sleep problems
without sg.

libosd's members all receive a gfp_t parameter and let the caller
determine the sleep policy. For example in osdblk allocations are
done with GFP_ATOMIC. At the exofs level everything is GFP_KERNEL
because that is one of the rules of VFS API. So osdblk should
theoretically be able to swap.

That said, in current kernel an iscsi device cannot be used for swap
because of NET. There was grate progress done to try and swap over
nfs which improved iscsi as well, but it was never seen all the way
through.

So if this is serious, them maybe call copy_from_user_inatomic to match
the GFP_ATOMIC allocation?
