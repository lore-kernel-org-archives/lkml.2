I am unable to reproduce this behaviour.  Can you give more information
about your storage configuration?  What is the partition layout, which
partition are you trying to mount, and are you using the standard mount
command to try to mount it?  Is there anything else you can provide that
would help me reproduce the problem?

Thanks,
Jeff
