I don't want to flame. I mean this:

* person X writes a patch P.
* person Y reads P, sees that the condition C is true and writes patch Q 
that dependes on condition C.
* person X changes a patch P, so that the patch is correct but condition C 
is no longer true.

Now, there is a bug in the patch Q and NEITHER X NOR Y can find out about 
that bug.

That's why parallel development doesn't work.

If you develop on things in the kernel, it is different.
* person X writes a patch P and puts it in the kernel.
* person Y reads the kernel code, sees that the condition C is true and 
writes a patch Q that assumes that the condition C is true. He puts this 
patch to the kernel too.
* person X wants to change his code so that the condition C isn't true, 
but it is now his responsibility to search the rest of the kernel to see 
if it depends on the condition C. He searches the code and finds Q.

This is not a flamewar, just a technical explanation, why I don't want to 
develop on interfaces that are not in the kernel.
