This patch series allows binding the nfs and rpc logic to a specific local
IP address.

Features/Benefits:

*  Allow multiple unique mounts to the same server using unique
   source IP addresses on client system.

   Routing rules can then be created based on the source IP address for
   advanced routing of the NFS traffic.

   This could allow someone to use two 1G interfaces to access a
   server with 10G connectivity and allow aggregate 2Gbps transfer,
   for instance.

   This is also useful for load testing NFS servers as well as the
   client-side NFS logic (note the bugs & fixed found while testing
   this code!)

*  Allow using a specific IP address on multi-homed system.  This could
   increase security in some cases and in general gives the user more
   control over how the services are configured.

This code has been tested under load on 3.0 and a similar version has
been tested under load on 2.6.38 and previous kernels.

Full implementation of this feature requires patches to mount.nfs,
which have been agreed to be accepted if the kernel patches are accepted.

Ben Greear (12):
  sunrpc:  Don't attempt to bind to AF_UNSPEC address.
  nfs:  Two AF_UNSPEC addresses should always match each other.
  nfs:  Add srcaddr member to nfs_client.
  nfs:  Use request destination addr as callback source addr.
  nfs:  Pay attention to srcaddr in v4.1 callback logic.
  nfs:  Use srcaddr in nfs_match_client.
  nfs:  Add srcaddr to /proc/fs/nfsfs/servers
  nfs:  Pass srcaddr into mount request.
  nfs:  Propagate src-addr in client code.
  nfs: Bind to srcaddr in rpcb_create.
  nfs: Support srcaddr= to bind to specific IP address.
  lockd: Support binding nlm client to specific address.
