OK.  So, personally: I'm resigned to the idea that we want support for
this ACL model.  The vfs changes look OK to me (and wouldn't be changed
by any comments I'd have on the more richacl-specific patches to
follow).  So that's an ACK from me on the first set of these patches,
assuming it's OK with people to merge these things one step at a time.
