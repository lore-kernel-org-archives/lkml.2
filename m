Just to close this issue:  We ran a clean 24+ hour test mounting and
unmounting 200 mounts every 30 seconds, and it ran with zero problems.

This was with 2.6.38.8+ with this fix applied.

3.0-rc7+ is still flaky in various other ways, but I see no more
NFS problems at least.

So, that was the problem I was hitting, and it appears to be the
last problem in this area.

Thanks,
Ben
