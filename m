The linux-next branch contains pm-freezer (or at least it's supposed to).

The point is to let the patches stay in linux-next for a couple of days
before moving them to the pm-freezer branch to see if there's any fallout (I'm
not going to rebase pm-freezer, so fixing it will require addtional commits).

Thanks,
