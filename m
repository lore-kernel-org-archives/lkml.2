OK I take your word for it. But that sounds stupid to me. I would think
that sectors can be ordered. not commands per se. What happen with reads
then? do they get to be ordered? I mean a read in between the two writes which
value is read? It gets so complicated that only a sector model makes sense
to me.

I'm not hard on the specifics here. But I think the initiator has set
the same SN on the two paths, or has incremented them between paths.
You said:

So what was the SN sent to each side. Is there a relationship between them
or they each advance independently?

If there is a relationship then the targets on two sides should store
the SN for later comparison. (Life is hard)
