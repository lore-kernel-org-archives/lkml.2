So I just looked at this with an eye to validating an XFS
implementation, and I came up with this list of stuff that the test
does not cover that I'd need to test in some way:

	- files with clean unwritten extents. Are they a hole or
	  data? What's SEEK_DATA supposed to return on layout like
	  hole-unwritten-data? i.e. needs to add fallocate to the
	  picture...

	- files with dirty unwritten extents (i.e. dirty in memory,
	  not on disk). They are most definitely data, and most
	  filesystems will need a separate lookup path to detect
	  dirty unwritten ranges because the state is kept
	  separately (page cache vs extent cache).  Plenty of scope
	  for filesystem specific bugs here so needs a roubust test.

	- cold cache behaviour - all dirty data ranges the test
	  creates are hot in cache and not even forced to disk, so
	  it is not testing the no-page-cache-over-the-data-range
	  case. i.e. it tests delalloc state tracking but not
	  data-extent-already exists lookups during a seek.

	- assumes that allocation size is the block size and that
	  holes follows block size alignment. We already know that
	  ext4 does not follow that rule when doing small sparse
	  writes close together in a file, and XFS is also known to
	  fill holes when doing sparse writes past EOF.

	- only tests single block data extents ѕo doesn't cover
	  corner cases like skipping over multiple fragmented data
	  extents to the next hole.

Some more comments in line....

The log file is usually named $seq.full, and doesn't get placed in
the filesystem being tested. It gets saved in the xfstests directory
along side $seq.out.bad for analysis whenteh test fails...

Personally I'd prefer the test to be a bit noisy about what it is
running, especially when there are so many subtests the single
invocation is running. It makes no difference to the run time ofthe
test, or the output when something fails, but it at least allows you
to run the test manually and see what it is doing easily...

I'd suggest that rw and prealloc (once unwritten extent
testing is added) groups should also be defined for this test.

Otherwise, the test code looks ok if a bit over-engineered....

So, to take from the hole punch test matrix, it covers a bunch more
file state transitions and cases that are just as relevant to
SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA. Those cases are:

#       1. into a hole
#       2. into allocated space
#       3. into unwritten space
#       4. hole -> data
#       5. hole -> unwritten
#       6. data -> hole
#       7. data -> unwritten
#       8. unwritten -> hole
#       9. unwritten -> data
#       10. hole -> data -> hole
#       11. data -> hole -> data
#       12. unwritten -> data -> unwritten
#       13. data -> unwritten -> data
#       14. data -> hole @ EOF
#       15. data -> hole @ 0
#       16. data -> cache cold ->hole
#       17. data -> hole in single block file

I thikn we also need to cover most of these same cases, right?  And
SEEK_HOLE/SEEK data also need to explicitly separate the unwritten
tests into "clean unwritten" and "dirty unwritten" and cover the
transitions between regions of those states as well, right?

Cheers,

Dave.
