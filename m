I think that's acceptable device behaviour, but it's not guaranteed
device behaviour, as far as I can tell.  Receiving the abort and then
the task isn't guaranteed to abort the task.

Agreed.

Agreed.

It might be more efficient too.  If we cycle through, we can start by
just trying to assign the next tag; it will likely succeed.  If it's
already assigned, then we can search.

Definitely!

This one confuses me, though.  I've not seen it happen.  As far as I can
tell, the SCSI layer will either send a single untagged command, or it
will send one-or-more tagged commands.  I haven't been able to provoke it
into sending an untagged command _and_ a tagged command at the same time.

For UAS, I didn't reserve a tag; I just use tag 0 for untagged
commands, and refuse to send a tagged command if there's an untagged
command outstanding.  I could put a printk in to see if that logic
ever triggers...

SPC-4 seems to indicate (in the INQUIRY command, 6.4.2) that support
for queueing is now non-optional, and even support for basic queueing
has been removed, replaced only with the 'command management model'.
I must confess to being somewhat confused by the difference between the
'basic queue' model and 'command management' model, but ideally as a
driver writer, I shouldn't have to understand it (because it would be
handled for me by the SCSI core).
