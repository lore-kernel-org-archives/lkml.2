D'oh.  I'll give it another whirl...

Please pull from git://oss.sgi.com/xfs/xfs for-linus  

I've updated it with changes for 3.4.  We have scalability improvements
for quotas, log grant code cleanups, bugfixes and other cleanups large
and small.

Ok, I won't worry too much about avoiding conflict anymore.  Summary and
diffstat below.
