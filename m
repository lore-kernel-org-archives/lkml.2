Subject: [patch,v3 00/10] make I/O path allocations more numa-friendly

Hi,

This patch set makes memory allocations for data structures used in
the I/O path more numa friendly by allocating them from the same numa
node as the storage device.  I've only converted a handful of drivers
at this point.  My testing showed that, for workloads where the I/O
processes were not tied to the numa node housing the device, a speedup
of around 6% was observed.  When the I/O processes were tied to the
numa node of the device, there was no measurable difference in my test
setup.  Given my relatively low-end setup[1], I wouldn't be surprised
if others could show a more significant performance advantage.

Comments would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
Jeff

fronting a RAID 6 10+2.  The workload I used was tuned to not
have to hit disk.  Fio file attached.

changes from v2->v3:
- Made the numa_node Scsi_Host structure member dependent on CONFIG_NUMA
- Got rid of a GFP_ZERO I added accidentally
changes from v1->v2:
- got rid of the vfs patch, as Al pointed out some fundamental
  problems with it
- credited Bart van Assche properly
