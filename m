Right. One has to consider that samba has to satisfy READDIRPLUS-like
calls, and on a large directory all of those extra syscalls are likely
to impact performance.

In my view, the ideal thing would be to add this field as an EA and
continue work on implementing xstat(). Adding it as an EA gives
userland a way to set this value, without needing to add a new utimes()
variant.

If/when xstat becomes available, samba could use that instead of the EA
for reading this value.
