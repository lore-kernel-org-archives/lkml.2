That's not necessarily the case, at least not with NFS. It's easily
possible for you to do a full-fledged lookup over the wire, and then
for that inode to be removed prior to issuing a call against the FH that
you got back.

Again, it's not pointless. It's possible (though somewhat pathological)
for you to hit the race above more than once in the same operation.
Granted, it's an unlikely race but it is possible.

To do that would require protocol support that we simply don't have. We
don't have a way to (for instance) say via NFS "give me the attributes
for this filename". Well, at least not for NFSv3...

With v4 you could theoretically construct a compound that does that,
but you'd have to assume that the server won't release the reference to
the inode midway through the compound. That's a reasonably safe
assumption.

While it's nice to consider new atomic ops like this, it's not really
possible with earlier versions of NFS.
