OK, now I see.  That is the purpose of the "atomic update" checks;
i.e., seeing whether the ctime/mtime on the inode equals the
pre_ctime/pre_mtime in the fattr.

Well, I know why my change fixes it:  Because that code path is
updating the mtime in the inode to a value that matches the mtime on
the server even though the dentry lookup cache is actually out of
date.

However, it could have become out of date much earlier...  And then
subsequent operations from the client "know" they are the ones
updating the mtime, thus preserving the stale cache indefinitely.

In other words, once my lookup cache gets into this bad state, it will
stay that way until some other client (or the server) updates the
directory.  My patch flushes the cache even for operations that
originate on the client itself, thus working around the bug without
fixing it.

Yeah, assuming the "atomic action" logic is correct, I agree.

This also explains why the problem is so hard to reproduce.  In my
application, the client checks for the existence of the file at almost
exactly the same time it is being created on the server.  This may
well be triggering a race in the server that violates the atomicity
guarantees of NFS WCC.  And once the cache becomes stale on my client,
it stays that way in spite of additional client-side directory
modifications.

Thank you for the quick replies.  Obviously I need to investigate further.
