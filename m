Is this problem mostly hit in XFS with dedicated service threads like
kNFSd and similar, or is it a problem with any user thread perhaps
entering the filesystem for memory reclaim inside an already-deep
stack?

For dedicated service threads I was wondering about allocating larger
stacks for just those processes (16kB would be safe), and then doing
something special at thread startup to use this larger stack.  If
the problem is for any potential thread, then the solution would be
much more complex in all likelihood.

Cheers, Andreas
