The correct order is to allocate the transaction, reserve the space
for it and then take the ilock.  We cannot hold the ilock over the
transaction reservation because that can deadlock the journal.

That is, to make space for the new transaction reservation, we may
need to take the ilock to flush the inode and allow the journal tail
to move forwards to make space for the new transaction.  If we
already hold the ilock, then it can't be flushed, we can't make
space available in the journal and hence deadlock.

Maybe you confused the ilock vs the iolock.  We can hold the iolock
over the trans alloc/reserve because that lock is not required to
move the tail of the journal, so the deadlock doesn't exist.

Where are we taking the ilock and then calling xfs_trans_alloc()?
That's the caller needs to be fixed, not the 40-odd that do the
right thing by taking the ilock -after- the trans alloc/reserve
calls.

Cheers,

Dave.
