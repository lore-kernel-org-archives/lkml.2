Well you still have your sense of humour...

I've never understood why you think it's about the file manager /
desktop, or why you so strongly dislike the feature.  It originated
there historically, but that is not it's primary use.

The implementation, sure, but you seem to dislike the very *principle*
of subscribing to changes.

Every interesting use of inotify that I've seen is for some kind of
cache support, to eliminate the majority of stat() calls, to remove
disk I/O (no stat means no inode), to ensure correctness (st_mtime is
coarse and unreliable), and to avoid having to modify every
application which might affect any file from which cached items are
derived to explicitly notify all the applications which might use any
of those files.

You like high performance, reliable and correct behaviour, and high
scalability.  So I have never understood why you dislike the
change-subscription principle so strongly, because it is a natural
ally to those properties.

All the best,
