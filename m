Hi Jeff/James,

Just to add a thought - this issues is not related with ATA, this is
primarily related with HDD's with a USB interface i.e., SCSI <-> USB.
And, when I check my kernel config, CONFIG_ATA is not selected,
libata-scsi - this gets compiled only in case CONFIG_ATA is on.
Are these two things inter-related?

Please let us know.

Thanks & Regards,
Amit Sahrawat
