Sorry, but I forgot to mention one more important goal I would like to achieve:
I want to manage sysctl's variables in context of mount owner, but not viewer one.
IOW imagine, that we have one two network namespaces: "A" and "B". Both of them 
have it's own net sysctl's root. And we have per-net sysctl "/proc/sys/var".
And for ns "A" variable was set to 0, and for "B" - to 1.
And B's "/proc/sys/var" is accessible from "A" namespace
("/chroot_path/proc/sys/var" for example).
With this configuration I want to read "1" from both namespaces:
owner "B" (/proc/sys/var) and "A" ("/chroot_path/proc/sys/var").
Looks like simple using of register_net_sysctl_table doesn't allow me this, 
because current net ns is used. And to achieve this goal I need my own sysctl 
set for SUNRPC like it was done for network namespaces.

I'm afraid, that this approach this not allow me to achieve the goal, mentioned 
above, because current->nsproxy->net_ns will be used during lookup.
Or maybe I misunderstanding here?

Was glad to be usefull.
