Hi Linus,

Please pull from:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git for_linus
or
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git upstream-merge

the merge is somewhat complex, since there's been a lot of work going on
in parallel with discard and zeroout changes, as well as the change
block_prepare_write/__block_write_begin.  The changes pass the xfstests
regression test suite, using both 1k and 4k block sizes --- both before
the upstream merge (the for_linus branch) and after doing a trial merge
with the head of your tree as of Wednesday evening (the upstream-merge
branch).

The changes this time around have two major features, which are
responsible for most of the new lines of code.  One is lazy inode table
initialization, which allows ext4 file systems to be mkfs'ed very
quickly.  The second is changing the I/O submission path so that it uses
the block I/O layer directly.  This makes blktraces much smaller, and
makes ext4 far more scalable.  On the boxacle "large file create"
workload, run with 48 and 192 threads on a 48-core AMD box, ext4 now has
a 3x increase in write throughput, and CPU usage has been reduced by a
factor of 3-4.  Most of this was achieved by reducing spinlock
contention on the block queue submission locks.

We also added support for run-time discard of unused blocks using the
new FITRIM ioctl (which has been run by the linux-fs mailing list as a
generic file system-independent interface).

And, of course, a lot of bug fixes and clean ups.
