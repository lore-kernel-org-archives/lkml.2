The only way you could legimitaly get a real use-after-free problem if
you were overflowing the reference counter and pegged it at the max
value, was if you had code that could decrement the reference count as
many times as you incremented it.  So far, all bugs we've seen are
one-off where on an error path, we forgot to decrement the count.  So
how could the decrement ever happen?

I'm not saying it is a "recoverable" state, but to crash the machine is
not acceptable.  At the very least, let the user know something went
wrong, and stick around long enough to let them know and do something,
before shutting the thing down.

But before people start micro-engineering this whole thing, remember,
I'm still not sold on this type of change at all.

p.s. Has anyone ever tried an endless open() loop on a sysfs file to see
     what happens today?...
