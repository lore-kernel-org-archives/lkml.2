This is useful background that I think would be good have int the changelog.

I'm still bothers that the proposed patch can cause exec to fail for an
separate 'innocent' process.
It also seems to 'hide' the problem - just shuffling code around.
The comment in do_execve_common helps.  A similar comment in set_user
wouldn't hurt.

But what do you think of this.  It sure that only the process which ignored
the return value from setuid is inconvenienced.

commit e47554d38340d4c4c3eccf207de682fe6b29224e
Author: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>
Date:   Fri Jul 15 13:20:09 2011 +1000

    Protect execve from being used after 'setuid' has failed.
    
    Many programs do not check setuid for failure so when it fails they
    might continue to use elevated privileged without intending to.
    Of particular concern is a call to 'exec' as this is common after
    dropping privileges and allows the elevated privileges to be misused.
    
    The patch http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/13/226 introduced a RLIMIT_NPROC
    check in set_user() to check for NPROC exceeding via setuid() and
    similar functions.  Before the check there was a possibility to greatly
    exceed the allowed number of processes by an unprivileged user if the
    program relied on rlimit only.  But the check created new security
    threat: many poorly written programs simply don't check setuid() return
    code and believe it cannot fail if executed with root privileges.  So,
    when the check fails we set a process flag which causes execve to fail.
    
    Following examples of vulnerabilities due to processes not checking
    error from setuid provided by Solar Designer <solar@openwall.com>:
    
    Here are some examples for 2011-2010:
    
    "... missing setuid() retval check in opielogin which leads to easy root
    compromise":
    
    http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/22/6
    
    "The /usr/lib/libgnomesu/gnomesu-pam-backend suid binary which belongs
    to the libgnomesu package is not checking setuid() return values.
    
    As a result, two cooperating users, or users with access to guest,
    cgi or web accounts can run arbitrary commands as root very easily."
