The return from nsm_client_get() is either from nsm_create() or from
ln->nsm_clnt.

nsm_create's return is from rpc_create, and it doesn't look possible for
rpc_creat to return NULL.

So probably we have some case where, while holding ln->nsm_clnt_lock,
you can see ln->nsm_users nonzero, but ln->nsm_clnt NULL ?
