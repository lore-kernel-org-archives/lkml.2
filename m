That publication seems to mention 'creation time' only as an abstract concept.
The backup architecture keeps a history of the file all that way back to its
"creation time".
It doesn't appear to need or use a 'creation time' attribute stored with any
file.

I agree, it does seem like an intuitively valuable number - after all we each
have a birthday which we are very aware of and often make use of.  It is
often treated as part of our identity - just like you were mentioning that
the CIFS client uses creation-time to help identify files which lack the
'inode number' identifier that is the common tool in Unix and derivatives.

But I'm not convinced that it is *practically* useful.  The only practical
use beyond windows-compatibility that has been mentioned is a stronger
'identity' tag.  However inode+generation number, or "file-handle-fragment"
are better things to use for identifying a file than "creation time",
especially when the latter is settable.

So if we were to add something for native applications to use, I doubt that
it would be 'creation time' (but I'm still open to hearing a convincing
use-case).

So we are left with an attribute that is needed for windows compatibility,
and so just needs to be understood by samba and wine.  Some filesystems might
support it efficiently, others might require the use of generic
extended-attributes, still others might not support it at all (I guess you
store it in some 'tdb' and hope it works well enough).

Core-linux doesn't really need to know about this - there just needs to be a
channel to pass it between samba/wine and the filesystem. xattr still seems
the best mechanism to pass this stuff around.  Team-samba can negotiate with
fs developers to optimise/accelerate certain attributes, and linux-VFS
doesn't need to know or care (except maybe to provide generic non-blocking or
multiple-access interfaces).

What is 'creation time' used for in the windows world??? Maybe there really
is something valuable here that we are missing....
