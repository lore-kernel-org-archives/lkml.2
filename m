[the same /dev, /proc and /sys]

	Very interesting.  Do you have anything mounted on the corresponding
directories on server?  The picture looks like you are getting empty
fhandles in readdir+ respons for exactly the same directories that happen
to be mountpoints on client.  In any case, we shouldn't do that blind
d_drop() - empty fhandles can happen.  The only remaining question is
why do they happen on that set of entries.  From my reading of
encode_entryplus_baggage() it looks like we have compose_entry_fh()
failing for those entries and those entries alone.  One possible cause
would be d_mountpoint(dchild) being true on server.  If it is true, we
can declare the case closed; if not, I really wonder what's going on.

Note that if the same fs is mounted elsewhere, d_mountpoint() would mean
that something is mounted on top of that directory in _some_ instance;
not necessary the exported one.  Can you slap printks on fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c
compose_entry_fh() failure exits and see which one triggers server-side?
