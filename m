Hi Kay,

Thank you for looking at it.

If we can avoid serious problems, I will implement preferred name as
write once.

I have two idea for work preferred name from the very first steps during
early boot in initramfs.

1. I think we can provide udev rules for preferred name in initramfs.
2. (option) I consider using user-defined name for the LUNs(*) because
   it is possible to get the name in initramfs. The user store preferred
   name in LUNs by sg command if available.
