Right.

sum_exec_runtime can be used for a process that has just been created,
but IIUC it cannot be used for a process that is being woken up from
sleeping(in [3/3] case).
Or, do you mean using p->se.sum_exec_runtime for [1/3] and p->state for [3/3] ?
If so, I'll do it in the next post.

I'll add comments.
