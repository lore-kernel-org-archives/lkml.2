This is the point: Which kind of modified B-tree data structure is best 
suited?

I think this is the most important design question in relation with 
filesystems that use some kind of B-trees, which means, if the wrong 
modified B-tree as the fundamental data structure was chosen, then this 
is a deep design bug.

This is a general problem of filesystem design, especially the packing 
and balancing heurisitcs, and a special problem of the Btrfs filesystem. 
You can't simply say do it in this or that way. That's why another 
filesystem uses something exotic like a B*-tree in conjunction with 
dancing trees as fundamental data structure, which leads back to the 
deep design question/problem/decision/bug/.... And after I followed the 
explanations of this exotic B-tree version by the main developer I knew 
just right from the start of the development of the Btrfs filesystem 
that it wasn't chosen the right modified B-tree data structure, because 
it was too simple and too general. And since some days I have the 
impression that there wasn't made a design decision at all with the only 
exception that there has to be some kind of a B-tree algorithm/data 
structure in the Btrfs filesystem.

And I also think that such a deep desgin decision can't simply be 
corrected in general (subjective opinion).

The found problem is the first problem with the chosen modified B-tree 
data structure. I wouldn't call it only a problem in a special case.

Yes, but ....
Firstly, maybe you are too focused on the classic B-tree algorithm here.
Secondly, a trick here, a split there, turning off a feature and then? 
Then we have complexity at then end, which brings us back to the start, 
the design decision.

But if you say there are no deep problems, then I will believe you for now.
