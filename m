That's effectively still a string.

Would it be so bad to have to introduce another xattr type if we needed
a new id type?  You'll have to modify the filesystem and the userspace
tools and everything anyway, won't you?

But if we decide we don't need strings, then at a minimum let's make
these some fixed small size.

You could do something like:

	struct richace_xattr {
		__le16		e_type;
		__le16		e_flags;
		__le32		e_mask;
		__le32		e_id[4];
	}

and just use e_id[0] for now.  That would still leave room for a 128-bit
id, or for a 32-bit uid + some-size namespace-id.

Cc'ing Eric Biederman in hopes of finding out whether that would satifsy
whatever wacky future ideas might be expected for user namespaces.
