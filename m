Twice today, on ThinkPad T420s running 3.2.0-rc6-next-20111222.
I haven't seen it at all under heavy load, but twice when simply
rebuilding the kernel - I think both times it hung with
"LD whatever/built-in.o" the last line on screen.

I had (a variant of) kdb in, here's the stack it gave me, but I think
I've got a bug in there which has missed out a number of stackframes:
so don't waste time puzzling over any anomalies in it, but there's
enough to suggest it's the same as Andrew was seeing.

I interrupted a few more times, yes, once or twice I caught it
in some cfq io_context business: didn't take much notice because
I thought I'd saved the stack to log, but it hasn't appeared in my
/var/log/messages after reboot.  Once or twice there was another
sh running on another cpu, showing a very similar stack.
