I like the concept, it's definitely useful (and your results amply
demonstrate that). I was thinking if there was a way in through the ioc
itself, rather than bdi -> queue and like you are doing. But I can't
think of a nice way to do it, so this is probably as good as it gets.

Unrelated change?

spin_lock_irq() is sufficient here.
