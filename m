Aargh ... I'm an idiot.  I should have thought of SLUB immediately ...
it's been causing oopses since debian switched to it.

So I recompiled the 2.6.38.4 stable kernel with SLAB instead of SLUB and
the problem goes away ... at least from three untar runs on a loaded
box ... of course it could manifest a few ms after I send this email ...

There are material differences, as well: SLAB isn't taking my system
down to very low memory on the untar ... it's keeping about 0.5Gb listed
as free.  SLUB took that to under 100kb, so it could just be that SLAB
isn't wandering as close to the cliff edge?
