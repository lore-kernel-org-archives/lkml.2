So there was an OOM going on but no messages in the log? Really strange.
Kame already asked about oom_score_adj of the processes in the group but
it didn't look like all the processes would have oom disabled, right?

This looks like a top-level group for your user.

OK, so all the memory is anonymous and you have no swap so the oom is
the only thing to do.

Hmm, all processes waiting for oom are stuck at the very same place:
$ grep mem_cgroup_handle_oom -r [0-9]*
30858/stack:[<ffffffff8110a9c1>] mem_cgroup_handle_oom+0x241/0x3b0
30859/stack:[<ffffffff8110a9c1>] mem_cgroup_handle_oom+0x241/0x3b0
30860/stack:[<ffffffff8110a9c1>] mem_cgroup_handle_oom+0x241/0x3b0
30892/stack:[<ffffffff8110a9c1>] mem_cgroup_handle_oom+0x241/0x3b0
30898/stack:[<ffffffff8110a9c1>] mem_cgroup_handle_oom+0x241/0x3b0
31588/stack:[<ffffffff8110a9c1>] mem_cgroup_handle_oom+0x241/0x3b0
32044/stack:[<ffffffff8110a9c1>] mem_cgroup_handle_oom+0x241/0x3b0
32358/stack:[<ffffffff8110a9c1>] mem_cgroup_handle_oom+0x241/0x3b0
6031/stack:[<ffffffff8110a9c1>] mem_cgroup_handle_oom+0x241/0x3b0
6534/stack:[<ffffffff8110a9c1>] mem_cgroup_handle_oom+0x241/0x3b0
7020/stack:[<ffffffff8110a9c1>] mem_cgroup_handle_oom+0x241/0x3b0

We are taking memcg_oom_lock spinlock twice in that function + we can
schedule. As none of the tasks is scheduled this would suggest that you
are blocked at the first lock. But who got the lock then?
This is really strange.
Btw. is sysrq+t resp. sysrq+w showing the same traces as
/proc/<pid>/stat?
 
> Notice that stack is different for few processes.

Yes others are in VFS resp ext3. ext3_write_begin looks a bit dangerous
but it grabs the page before it really starts a transaction.

Could you take few snapshots over time?

No

Do you see the same issue if only memory controller was mounted (resp.
cpuset which you seem to use as well from your description).

I know you said booting into a vanilla kernel would be problematic but
could you at least rule out te cgroup patches that you have mentioned?
If you need to move a task to a group based by an uid you can use
cgrules daemon (libcgroup1 package) for that as well.
