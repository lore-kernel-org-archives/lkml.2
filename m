Hmm.  I smell potential confusion for some otherwise POSIX-friendly
userspaces.

When I open /path/to/foo, call fstat (st_dev=2, st_ino=5678), and then
keep the file open, then later do a readdir which includes foo
(dir.st_dev=1, d_ino=1234), I'm going to immediately assume a rename
or unlink happened, close the file, abort streaming from it, refresh
the GUI windows, refresh application caches for that name entry, etc.

Because in the POSIX world I think open files have stable inode
numbers (as long as they are open), and I don't think that an open
file can have it's name's d_ino not match the inode number unless it's
a mount point, which my program would know about.

This plays into inotify, where you have to know if you are monitoring
every directory that contains a link to a file, to know if you need to
monitor the file itself directly instead.

Now I think it's fair enough that a union mount doesn't play all the
traditional rules :-)  C'est la vie.

This mismatch of (dir.st_dev,d_ino) and st_ino strongly resembles a
file-bind-mount.  Like bind mounts, it's quite annoying for programs
that like to assume they've seen all of a file's links when they've
seen i_nlink of them.

Bind mounts can be detected by looking in /proc/mounts.  st_dev
changing doesn't work because it can be a binding of the same
filesystem.

How would I go about detecting when a union mount's directory entry
has similar behaviour, without calling stat() on each entry?  Is it
just a matter of recognising a particular filesystem name in
/proc/mounts, or something more?

Thanks,
