we can divide the issue to 2 separate parts:

1) the inconsistent attribute by time delay between client and server:

   A) it is the nfs v2/v3 design issue, the "user" can understand (not
implementation mistake)
   B) we need make the time delay as shorter as we can. (this is the
reason why I call it "performance", although this "word" is still not
quit suitable)
   C) "user" can understand, not mean can bear (such as skipping writing
operation attribute changes)

2) the inconsistent attribute by a client itself:

   A) it is implementation issue, the "user" can not understand (it is
an implementation mistake)
   B) we need solve it (so I call it "correctness" issue).
   C) "user" can not understand, not mean can not bear (such as current
issue which I report)

at last, for maintainer:
   A) for "performance", we need try our best to do;
   B) for "correctness", we need fix it completely;

1) I think gencount is not equal to sequence number, the sequence number
can mark all relative tasks of one client in order.

2) I also think, it is not quite complex to make a client itself in
consistency. (it is implementation issue, not design issue)

1) I agree with you, in nfs_inode_attrs_need_update(), it need consider
this situation (the tasks from server return is not in order).

2) I do not think it can not be accomplished if the tasks of client
itself have sequence number.  (maybe, it would be enough to only judge
which task is later between the 2 tasks by sequence number).

1) I agree with what you said above, but maybe you misunderstand of what
I said for the "item B)"

2) the "item B)" is for the completion of "item A)". when we fix this
issue, maybe have to add additional synchronization code which maybe can
cause negative effect with performance, but I think it is not much
("user" can bear).

At last, I suggest we need think of how to fix this implementation bug
in nfs-client region.
