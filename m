Applied to the ext4 tree, with the following changes:

1)  I made the one-line summary clearer:

    ext4: fix i_blocks/quota accounting when extent insertion fails

2) I used the flag name EXT4_FREE_BLOCKS_NO_QUOT_UPDATE which was
clearer than "..._SKIP_QUPD".

Apologies for the delay in getting back to you, and thanks for the
patch.
