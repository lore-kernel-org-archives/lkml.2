Hi everyone,

The for-linus branch of the btrfs unstable repo:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mason/btrfs-unstable.git for-linus

Has our collection of fixes.  It's a little bigger than usual for rc2
because it includes Josef's queue of Btrfs changes.  It seemed best to
split them so we could concentrate on looking for any issues in the new
btrfs rc1 code from Fujitsu.  His tree is bug fixes and journal lock
reduction.

Some people have reported the initial caching of the free inode number
map (which happens only once when it is first enabled) is sucking down
too much CPU and IO time on their systems.  We don't have that one fixed
yet, but this pull does clean up a few other problems in the new inode
number allocatgor.  It also turns it off by default (mount -o
inode_cache to enable).

I was on the fence for turning this on by default, but we've already
kicked out three bugs so it seems best to keep it optional until 3.1.
