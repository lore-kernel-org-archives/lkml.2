The only difference between fd/X and dup(X) was the ability to write to
an fd opened as RO.  Now it is fixed:

$ ls -l 123
-rw-r--r-- 1 vasya vasya 0 Sep 14 18:21 123
$ id
uid=1008(new1) gid=1008(new1) groups=1008(new1)
$ bash 4< /tmp/123
new1@albatros:/tmp$ echo bla >&4
bash: 4: Bad file descriptor
new1@albatros:/tmp$ echo bla >/proc/$$/fd/4
bash: /proc/8527/fd/4: Permission denied

I don't really see any difference between opening fd/* and dup'ing file
descriptors with the current code.

Actually now I see the difference between having something mapped and
having an _fd_ of this something.

Relevant code:

+static struct dentry *
+proc_map_files_instantiate(struct inode *dir, struct dentry *dentry,
+              struct task_struct *task, const void *ptr)
+{
...
+   inode->i_mode = S_IFLNK;
+
+   if (file->f_mode & FMODE_READ)
+       inode->i_mode |= S_IRUSR | S_IXUSR;
+   if (file->f_mode & FMODE_WRITE)
+       inode->i_mode |= S_IWUSR | S_IXUSR;


If you have a write mmap area, but no fd, you may not trunc a file; with
map_files/ you may get an fd and ftrunc it.

ptrace() check is irrelevant to the access bypasses by the task owner.

Only closing fd presense leak:

Unfortunatelly, not yet applied/commented :(
