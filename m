I think this really screws with using seccomp for self-interception.  I
wouldn't inherently be opposed to the following flow:

	seccomp -> ptrace -> seccomp

... i.e. if ptrace is enabled and we enable something, run it through
seccomp again, but there are bunch of use cases (mostly involving
SIGSYS) where doing ptrace before seccomp is just bizarre.
