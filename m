Subject: [GIT PULL] Disintegrate UAPI for ia64 [ver #2]
Date: Tue, 09 Oct 2012 10:15:29 +0100

Can you merge the following branch into the ia64 tree please.

This is to complete part of the UAPI disintegration for which the preparatory
patches were pulled recently.

Now that the fixups and the asm-generic chunk have been merged, I've
regenerated the patches to get rid of those dependencies and to take account of
any changes made so far in the merge window.  If you have already pulled the
older version of the branch aimed at you, then please feel free to ignore this
request.

The following changes since commit 9e2d8656f5e8aa214e66b462680cf86b210b74a8:

  Merge branch 'akpm' (Andrew's patch-bomb) (2012-10-09 16:23:15 +0900)
