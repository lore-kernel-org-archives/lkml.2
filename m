I do not think that just because some people feel it is easier to change
the kernel than change userspace tools, that we are somehow forced to
accept their changes.

As for "expediency", it has been a full year since the last time this
was proposed.  All userspace tools that would need to be changed to
implement this in userspace have had updates released for them in that
year, and the changes needed to make to them could have been done
already.

So any argument about "quickness" here which requires a kernel change
instead of fixing userspace programs is totally false, sorry.
