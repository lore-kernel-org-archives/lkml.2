I think so. IOW success == event was sent to all active listeners.

BTW I do not see ENOBUFS but ESRCH (from netlink_broadcast_filtered).

If spurious failure is that event is sent (even partially) but it reports
failure, it is the exact situation I see now - libdevmapper will try
to decrement system semaphore which is already removed from udev rules.

Final state is correct, just it prints ugly warnings. IOW it recovers
from this situation correctly.

But Kay's suggestion to use netlink_has_listeners() seems like good
idea. IOW if there is no listener, it should skip quietly and not
fail the whole call...
