ok, so let me explain it. In commit 
2d1ff3c75a4642062d314634290be6d8da4ffb03, I add the mode for extent 
query of fiemap for xfs. So with your test file, it will return that we 
have 8 extents(because in xfs_fiemap_format we don't return holes). So 
normally and naturally, a user begin to iterate all the extents by doing

fiemap = malloc(sizeof(fiemap) + 8 * sizeof(struct fiemap_extent));
fiemap->fm_extent_count = 8

But what will happen? He will only get 4 extent. So do you think it is 
acceptable for a user? We told him that we have 8 extents, he has 
allocated enough space, but he can't get what he wanted. And he need to
fiemap = malloc(sizeof(fiemap) + 16 * sizeof(struct fiemap_extent));
fiemap->fm_extent_count = 16
to get 8 extent for your test file.

yeah, filefrag is really broken.

see my above test case. I guess we really don't want a userspace user to 
allocate num_extents * 2 + 1 fiemap_extent to get them.

We just change the size of our 'out', we don't change fi_extent_max or 
anything related to the fiemap. So I think what we care is how to keep 
our 'out' in good shape and fiemap should handle and check their 
fi_extent_max if we pass it more extents.

btw, maybe there is a better solution for the problem I described above. 
If there is a good one, I am happy to accept it.
