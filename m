Yes, sure is.

[ Well, to be precise the original NFSv2 specification
didn't have this flaw because all writes were synchronous. NFSv3
introduced asynchronous writes (writeback caching) and with it this
problem. NFSv4 does not fix this flaw. ]

Yup, well known issue. Simple rule: don't run your NFS server out of
space.

This isn't a NFS server problem, or one that canbe worked around at
the server. it's a NFS _client_ problem in that it does not get
synchronous ENOSPC errors when using writeback caching. There is no
way for the NFS client to know the server is near ENOSPC conditions
prior to writing the data to the server as clients operate
independently.

If you really want your NFS clients to behave correctly when the
server goes ENOSPC, turn off writeback caching at the client side,
not the server (i.e. use sync mounts on the client side).
Write performance will suck, but if you want sane ENOSPC behaviour...

Use wireshark to determine if the server sends an ENOSPC to the
client when the first background write fails. I bet it does and that
your dd write failed with ENOSPC, too. Something stopped it writing
at 1.9GB....

What happens to the remaining cached writeback data in the NFS
client once the server runs out of space is NFS client specific
behaviour. If you end up with only bits of the file on the server,
ending up on the server, then that's a result of NFS client
behaviour, not a NFS server problem.

Cheers,

Dave.
