Then look again: libata handles the transport quirks and sr handles the
capability quirks.  SCSI handles the protocol quirks.

But we already have that, if you look.  Part of what you're removing is
the proc interface that allows on demand loading.  If you just want the
ability to compile out the built in table and load everything from boot,
that's about a two line patch.
