Er... not in this case, you don't.  If a macro argument is passed verbatim
as an argument to a function, it doesn't need additional parens.

That's because the one guarantee you have about a macro argument is
that it can't contain any (unquoted) commas, and there's nothing lower
precedence than the comma.  So it's safe to delimit a macro argument
with *either* parens *or* a comma.

So you can go ahead and write:

#define hash_min(val, bits) \
	(sizeof(val) <= 4 ? hash_32(val, bits) : hash_long(val, bits))

... which is easier to read, anyway.
