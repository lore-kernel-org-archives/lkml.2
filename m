Yes, it's a proxy for something else.  One of our larger products would like to
use fsync() to flush dirty data out to disk (right now it looks like they use
O_SYNC), but they're concerned that the many threads they use can create an
fsync() storm.  So, they wanted to know how to mitigate the effects of those
storms.  Not calling fsync() except when they really need to guarantee a disk
write is a good start, but I'd like to get ahead of them to pick off more low
hanging fruit like the barrier coordination and not sending barriers when
there's no dirty data ... before they run into it. :)
