I think that is still very much a true statement. By the time normal disks 
return an error, they have retried *many* times in firmware. There are some 
exceptions of course - vibrations and so on might make this useful.

Back when my day job often involved recovering data from dead drives, we 
actually normally wanted to cut retries down to zero since various part of the 
stack retried for us so much that each bad sector had to be timed out multiple 
times!

I don't object to making this a tunable, but we should default to not retrying.

Also would be very interesting to seeing if this actually is useful in the real 
world, not just "word on the street" world :)
