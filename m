Well, I think that you overestimate the importance of scsi code too much.

There is a layering violation in the code. So what --- you either fix the 
layering violation or let it be there and grind your teeth on it. But in 
either case, that layering violation won't affect anyone except scsi 
developers.

On the other hand, if you say "because we want to avoid layering violation 
in SCSI, every issuer of discard request must supply an empty page", you 
create havoc all over the Linux codebase. md, dm, drbd, xvd, virtio --- 
whatever you think of, will be allocating a dummy page when constructing 
a discard request.

If the layering violation spans only scsi code, it can be eventually 
fixed, but this, much worse "layering violation" that will be spanning all 
block device midlayers, won't ever be fixed.

Imagine for example --- a discard request arrivers at a dm-snapshot 
device. The driver splits it into chunks, remaps each chunk to the 
physical chunk, submits the requests, the elevator merges adjacent 
requests and submits fewer bigger requests to the device. Now, if you had 
to allocate a zeroed page each time you are splitting the request, that 
would exhaust memory and burn cpu needlessly. You delete a 100MB file? --- 
fine, allocate a 100MB of zeroed pages.

So I say --- let there be a layering violation in the scsi code, but don't 
put this problem with a page allocation to all the other bio midlayer 
developers.
