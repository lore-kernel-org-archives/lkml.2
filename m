Applications need to handle mappings changing from query to getting
the mapping, so this should not be a major issue. Especially as the
method of fiemap indicating there are more extents to be extracted
from the inode in the case the kernel can't allocate a buffer large
enough is already documented.

Realistically though, xfs_getbmap() needs a complete rewrite so
right now I'd prefer just to do the minimum to fix the reported
problem that continue to make it into even more of a mess than it is
now...

Cheers,

Dave.
