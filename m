OK, so thinking about this, it seems that the only danger is actually
what NFS is doing: reading cache pages via a vmap.  In that case, since
the requirement is to invalidate the vmap range to prepare for read, we
could have invalidate_kernel_vmap_range loop over the underlying pages
and flush them through the kernel alias if the architecture specific
flag indicates their contents might be dirty.

The loop adds expense that is probably largely unnecessary to
invalidate_kernel_vmap_range() but the alternative is adding to the API
proliferation with something that only flushes the kernel pages if the
arch specific flag says they're dirty.
