OK, will update.

Yeah, thanks, will update.

Fancy indenting really makes code easier to read, and in real
we do it in kernel as well, but ok, I'll drop it.

There are a couple of reasons. Yesterday I was talking to
Vasiliy Kulikov about this snippet, so he seems about to send
you patches related to /proc/$pid/fd update, and after those
patches will be merged we are to drop code duplication.
Vasiliy, what the status of the update?

Secondly, I've had a problems trying to download -mm patches
yesterday (I believe 'cause of kernel.org problem) so I rather
put this note here in patch just to *not* forget to do a cleanup
work once things calm down. And eventually, I believe this
cleanup should be separately in a sake of bisectability.

Again, this note is related to the future patch from Vasiliy
and mark for myself to not forget clean it up later.

Nod, thanks.

filldir calls for might_fault and need mmap_sem as well
(when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is set) and this makes lockdep
to complain. In real I revealed it during testing.

Yes, I'll add a test which one to use, either kmalloc, either vmalloc,
depending on size needed.

Because first loop may fail (break) and I still have to drop
refs to filep -- which in turn means I'll have to continue
from broken position, ie like this

	for (; i < used; i++)
		put_filp(info[i].file);

But, OK, I'll update. Thanks a huge for comments, Andrew!
