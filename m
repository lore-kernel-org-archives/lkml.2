I reached out to Fred Knight on this, to get a more insight from a pure
SCSI SBC perspective, and he shared the following:

----- End forwarded message -----

Seems like verifying/improving the handling of CHECK CONDITION is a more
pressing concern than silent data loss purely due to SYNCHRONIZE CACHE
retries.  Without proper handling we could completely miss these
deferred errors.

But how to effectively report such errors to upper layers is unclear to
me given that a particular SCSI command can carry error information for
IO that was already acknowledged successful (e.g. to the FS).

drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c's various calls to scsi_check_sense()
illustrate Linux's current CHECK CONDITION handling.  I need to look
closer at how deferred errors propagate to upper layers.  After an
initial look it seems scsi_error.c does handle retrying commands where
appropriate.

I believe Hannes has concerns/insight here.

Mike
