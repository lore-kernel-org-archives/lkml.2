Well, I gave it a spin on -rc2 with no problems and no significant change in
performance, so:

Hmm... I don't think a blacklist would work for our arrays, since one can force
them to run with write cache and no battery.  I _do_ have a patch that adds a
sysfs knob to the block layer to drop flush/fua if the admin really really
really wants it, so I'll send that out shortly along with another one to remove
the barrier= mount option from ext4.

(Unless the screams of objection rain from the skies. :))
