I've done plenty of testing here - the patch is part of my usual QA
stack so it's probably run through XFSQA a few hundred times now.

The behaviour w.r.t. writes into holes appears to be identical to
the current behaviour (i.e. sync hangs until the write stops). I
can't _see_ any difference in behaviour of increase in overhead, but
we all know that this doesn't mean there isn't one.

The test I ran to determine it's effectiveness against extending
writes was running sync during an 8GB sequential write. It would
hang every time until the write completes - typically around 50-60s
- without this patch. With this patch sync returns within 3-4s every
time.

Yes, that's already been pointed out. This doesn't attempt to
address that problem because....

.... we're still waiting for Jan's mark and sweep patch that does
this to make progress. This patch is just a simple fix for the most
common cause of the problem and might get into the tree sooner.

Personally I see no problems with using a mark+sweep algorithm for
this - IMO ensuring that data integrity requirements are met is more
important than ultimate performance.

Yes, b) is similar to the old code, but like the old code it doesn't
work for the data integrity case because it doesn't guarantee the
correct pages are written out. This patch does for the append case,
and a) guarantees it in all cases....

Cheers,

Dave.
