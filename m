I consider the context it adds to cscope searches a damn good reason
for keeping it.

Because that then kills context that is actually useful in cscope
searches. That is, every filesystem has the file "inode.c",
"super.c", etc and so you can't tell from the cscope searchs which
filesystem function calls belong to. 

Duplicate name spaces are evil, and we have a lot of them in the
filesystem tree - if they all had explicit namespacing like XFS
does, then the world would be a better place. ;)

The names make sense to anyone who has spent any time in the XFS
code. The name of the file reflects the namespace of the code inside
the file itself. e.g. to use the xfs_qm.c as an example:

$ grep ^xfs_qm_  fs/xfs/xfs_qm.c
xfs_qm_destroy(
xfs_qm_hold_quotafs_ref(
xfs_qm_rele_quotafs_ref(
xfs_qm_unmount(
xfs_qm_mount_quotas(
xfs_qm_unmount_quotas(
xfs_qm_dqflush_all(
xfs_qm_detach_gdquots(
xfs_qm_dqpurge_int(
xfs_qm_dqpurge_all(
xfs_qm_dqattach_one(
xfs_qm_dqattach_grouphint(
xfs_qm_dqattach_locked(
xfs_qm_dqattach(
xfs_qm_dqdetach(
xfs_qm_sync(
xfs_qm_init_quotainfo(
xfs_qm_destroy_quotainfo(
xfs_qm_list_init(
xfs_qm_list_destroy(
xfs_qm_qino_alloc(
xfs_qm_reset_dqcounts(
xfs_qm_dqiter_bufs(
xfs_qm_dqiterate(
xfs_qm_quotacheck_dqadjust(
xfs_qm_get_rtblks(
xfs_qm_dqusage_adjust(
xfs_qm_quotacheck(
xfs_qm_init_quotainos(
xfs_qm_dqreclaim_one(void)
xfs_qm_shake_freelist(
xfs_qm_shake_scan(
xfs_qm_shake_count(
xfs_qm_dqalloc_incore(
xfs_qm_write_sb_changes(
xfs_qm_vop_dqalloc(
xfs_qm_vop_chown(
xfs_qm_vop_chown_reserve(
xfs_qm_vop_rename_dqattach(
xfs_qm_vop_create_dqattach(

So there is a certain methodic sanity to the naming convention that
is not immediately obvious from just looking at the file names, and
that's a good reason not to change them.

Besides, I don't want to have to spend 3 months reprogramming
my muscle memory just because we painted the bikeshed a different
colour. ;)

Cheers,

Dave.
