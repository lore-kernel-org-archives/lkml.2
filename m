Exactly. The current behavior/interface is that we return ESTALE to
userspace, even when we have a pathname and can retry. That's a bad
interface that certainly isn't helpful to users.

ESTALE has a specific meaning -- stale NFS filehandle. If we expand
that definition a bit, then we can rephrase that to mean that the
results of the lookup now point to something that doesn't exist.

If FUSE or other filesystems are using ESTALE to mean something else,
then they're not returning the right error code. Is there something
documented in FUSE that told them to expect some specific behavior from
an ESTALE return?

Retrying indefinitely in that situation is sort of the point. What you
consider to be a DoS here could also be a completely valid use-case in
other situations. At least in the case of NFS, we have to expect "nice"
behavior out of the server. There are plenty of ways that the server
or another client can screw things up for you...

In any case, I think we can also minimize the impact on the system in
the event that we do have DoS. We can allow the user to break out of
the loop with a fatal signal. I also think we should take Chuck's
advice from earlier and add a backoff delay between retries to minimize
the impact while looping.

Here's sort of what I'm thinking. I'm still in the process of testing
this approach to make sure it does the right thing, so consider this
another RFC:
