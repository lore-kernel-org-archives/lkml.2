Hmm, I don't believe configfs currently supports a distinction between
permissions for something along these lines.

Yes, the "dangling" MappedLUNs symlinks for this special case would need
to be explictly removed via unlink(2) and then re-created using a new
TPG LUN struct se_lun->lun_group containing a valid symlink back to
a TCM Core backstore a valid configfs symlink source.
