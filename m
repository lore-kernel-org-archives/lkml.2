This still isn't right.  I said you could ignore most of the warnings
(like lines over 80 characters), but you have a lot of this:


> -			printk(KERN_NOTICE "arcmsr%d: memory mapping region fail \n", =
> acb->host->host_no);
> +			pr_notice("arcmsr%d: memory mapping"
> +				"region fail\n", acb->host->host_no);

I'm agnostic on whether you split a print, in spite of the warning but I
do tend to prefer longer lines, since they avoid the mistake you made
quite a few times, which is not leaving a space between the separate
words in the split string.  This will produce a message like

arcmsr1: memory mappingregion fail

Plus this indentation

Is being changed from correctly indented to incorrectly indented (writel
needs another tab).
