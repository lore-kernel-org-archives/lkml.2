The writeback code is tricky and easy to break in subtle ways.

So you want a ->writepage() implementation which doesn't actually write
a page at all - it just remembers that page for later.

Maybe that fs shouldn't be calling write_cache_pages() at all.  After
all, write_cache_pages() is a wrapper which emits a sequence of calls
to ->writepage(), and ->writepage() writes a page.

Rather than hacking around, subverting things and breaking core kernel
code, let's step back and more clearly think about what to do?

One option would be to implement a new address_space_operation which
provides the new semantics in a well-understood fashion.  Let's call it
writepage_prepare(?).  Then reimplement write_cache_pages() so that if
->writepage_prepare() is available, it handles it in a sensible fashion
and doesn't break traditional filesystems.

Or simply implement a new, different version of write_cache_pages() for
filesystems which wish to buffer in this fashion.  The new
write_cache_pages_prepare()(?) would call ->writepage_prepare(). 
Internally it might share implementation with write_cache_pages().

There are lots of options.  But the way in which write_cache_pages()
was extended to handle this ext4 requirement was rather unclean,
non-obvious and, umm, broken!
