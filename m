  Yes, it would be nice if ext3 did it the way ext4 does but as I already
said earlier, that's a major change to the way locking is done. ext3 has
lock ordering PageLock -> transaction start, while ext4 has lock ordering
transaction start -> PageLock. This influences a lot of places so it's too
big change to do to ext3 which is in maintenance only mode.

  You have to have the page locked to call that function. Otherwise someone
could invalidate the page under your hands (or do other sort of things
function does not expect).

  That's just more complicated way of implementing page lock ;) It won't
remove deadlocks.

  Yes, they do - for example in ext3_write_begin(), ext3_journal_start()
can sleep waiting for kjournald to commit a transaction :). That's the
deadlock I'm talking about...

  That's not an issue. Once transaction commit starts, no new buffers can
be added to it.

  Hum, I was thinking about how to implement proper exclusion in ext3 using
buffer locks and it won't be easy. Buffered writes are simple enough but
mmap is tricky - we'd have to writeprotect the page at the moment we add
buffer to t_sync_datalist (at that moment we hold the page lock so that is
doable). That page_mkwrite will have to wait for transaction commit (or
write the buffers) if underlying buffers are in t_sync_datalist. That will
make mixing of buffered IO and mmap writes to the same page very slow but
maybe that would be acceptable. I'll think about it some more...
