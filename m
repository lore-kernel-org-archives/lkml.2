These don't really make sense to be using ext2 constants.

These ones should be using the generic FS_IOC_{GET,SET}_FLAGS.

It isn't clear that there is any legitimate use for EXT2_IOC_SETVERSION, since it isn't possible to allocate specific inode numbers, so there isn't really any use to set the inode version.  Ostensibly it was for user-space NFS, but it can't be used for this, and we are planning to deprecate it from ext2/3/4 already due to incompatibility with the metadata checksum feature.
