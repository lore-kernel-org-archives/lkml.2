Not sure why it works than. I looked at config MD_RAID456
and from it's selects I only need ASYNC_XOR.
In later Kernels I will also need the RAID6_** stuff.

OK So I guess I need a much deeper change and move ORE to lib/ or I can do the
below change.

Please advise what you think is the best for now?

Thanks Randy for yur help

Subject: [PATCH] ore: FIX breakage when MISC_FILESYSTEMS is not set

As Reported by Randy Dunlap

When MISC_FILESYSTEMS is not enabled:

fs/built-in.o: In function `objio_alloc_io_state':
objio_osd.c:(.text+0xcb525): undefined reference to `ore_get_rw_state'
fs/built-in.o: In function `_write_done':
objio_osd.c:(.text+0xcb58d): undefined reference to `ore_check_io'
fs/built-in.o: In function `_read_done':
...

When MISC_FILESYSTEMS, which is more of a GUI thing then anything else,
is not selected. exofs/Kconfig is never examined during Kconfig,
and it can not do it's magic stuff to automatically select everything
needed.

We must split exofs/Kconfig in two the ore one is
always included and the exofs one is left in it's
old place in the menu.
