Good idea. If we go with an infinite retry or a large number of
attempts, then an exponential backoff would be good. Probably not
worthwhile though if we're only going to retry a dozen times or so.

We might also want to consider having this code bail out of the loop on
fatal_signal_pending() too. That would help cover the case of
filesystems that don't handle signals appropriately themselves.

There are 3 possible "problem" situations that I can see with an
infinite retry:

1) you have a filesystem that persistently returns ESTALE on a lookup
for some reason. That situation will never resolve itself if we retry
indefinitely without outside intervention.

2) a filesystem has a successful lookup but is handing out bogus inodes
such that the operation consistently fails with ESTALE. Again, that
will probably never resolve itself, and is probably indicative that
something is broken in the fs.

3) you have a situation where the results of the lookup consistently go
stale before the actual operation, and the operation returns ESTALE.
With NFS, this could happen if you had a job on the server renaming a
new file on top of an old one very rapidly while trying to access it in
some fashion from the other client. If timed just right, this could end
up in a livelock of sorts.

To answer your question above, I don't see any major difference
philosophically between retrying on ESTALE and retrying a v4 operation
on an OLD_STATEID error or something. That said, I'm not worried about
NFS here. I'm pretty sure it can cope in some fashion with all of the
above situations.

The big questions are whether that would cause problems with other
filesystems and if so, how best would we deal with it?
