That's not what I meant.

 - for linux/version.h:

	neither LINUX_VERSION_CODE nor KERNEL_VERSION is used anywhere in
	the target code, so it can't possibly required at all.

 - for linux/utsname.h and <generated/utsrelease.h>:

	please either remove the attributes printing this information
	into common code.  or better off just remove it all all.  You can
	get the kernel version and release from the utsname system call,
	there is absolutely no need to duplicate it in a different attribute in
	every target frontend.
	Also printing it during initialization is completely pointless, too.

Also please make tiqn_access_count a normal integer type, it is always
protected by tiqn_state_lock.

Looks like none of the initiator code currently uses iscsi_, but I'd still
feel better about iscsit_ to make sure we're not conflicting with other
initiator side code.

Take a look at include/linux/idr.h.

Note that the uses for np_index, tpg_np_index and conn_index can be
removed entirely as they are unused.

or sometimes spinlocks.  Or often removed at all, as they just implement weird
semantics for the threads - no need to have startup/shutdown synchronization
as the kthread semantics are synchronous, and for a wakeup after queueing
up work a simple wake_up_process on the task_struct pointer is enough.

If you have question on how to avoid certain uses feel free to ask.

Note that you might get away with less copies using the sk_data_ready,
sk_state_change callbacks and tcp_read_sock() and totally dropping the
traditional recvmsg path.  As this remove the blocking behaviour it
will as a side effect also remove any issues with thread startup/stop.

Take a look at drivers/scsi/iscsi_tcp.c for an implementation.

It's not just the casts - macros just for dereferencing a field just obsfucate
the code.
