Let's first clarify what you mean by an unwritten extent?  Do you mean a
preallocated extent that returns 0 when read, or do you mean a delayed
allocation extent that was written by the application that is still in
memory but not yet written to disk?

Unfortunately, ZFS has no concept of preallocated extents, so we can't
look to it for precedent, but it definitely has delayed allocation.
Possibly if UFS on Solaris has SEEK_HOLE and also preallocated extents
(I have no idea) it could be tested?

My thought would be that a preallocated extent is still a HOLE, because
it doesn't contain data that an application actually cares about.  On
the other hand, a delalloc extent is DATA because it has something that
an application cares about.

The original reason SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA were brought up over FIEMAP was
"cp" being able to consistently access delalloc data that was only in
the page cache, so if we don't get that right it will have been a pointless
exercise.

I would think only the "data" part, since that is what the definition
of "SEEK_DATA" is IMHO.
