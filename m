Good point, thanks.  Also I've missed /proc/stat - it contains the same
interrupt counters.

I dissagree with you.  If not pay an attention to historical procfs
flaws, they will never be fixed.  If we know some subsystem leaks much
private information because of some historical incidents, we still must
fix it.  If some subsystem has flaws here and there, it probably needs
a redesign or at least more accurate audit.

Sure, but 2 notes here.

First, the number of characters is indeed not really harmful, but the
precise timings can provide additional information, which can be matched
against the statistical information about how much time it takes to move
fingers between different keys.  This can be used to gain a valuable
probabilistic information about the password characters, and running the
attack several times can result in the _precise_ passwords learning.  The
details of the attack can be found here:

https://db.usenix.org/event/sec09/tech/full_papers/zhang.pdf


Second, ability to protect local users from each other is a core
feature of multiuser systems.  One user must not get private keys of
other users, must not be able to listen ttys of other users, etc.  The
issue with side channel attacks is much more complex (e.g. it's really
hard to design a scheduler to remove all possible indirect infoleaks via
schedule delays), but the issue in question is not so tricky, quite the
opposite - relaxed permissions.

Huh?  Do you claim that current Linux doesn't implement the multiuser
system _by design_?  Do you say every distro that doesn't use any LSMs
(like Debian) is actually not a true multiuser system?  Or am I missing
your point?

What's wrong with old good DAC?  You can create a group "sysinfo", do
"chown sysinfo /proc/interrupts", and add the permitted users to the
group.  If you need to give different access levels to different interrupts,
you need another /proc/interrupts design, it does nothing with DAC vs. LSM.
