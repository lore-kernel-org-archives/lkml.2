Just to give one example from a different angle:
In the big datacenters tape libraries are still very important, and lots
of them have a scsi attachement. virtio-blk certainly is not the right
way to handle those. Furthermore it seems even pretty hard to craft
a virtio-tape since most of those libraries have vendor specific library
controls (via sg). We would need to duplicate scsi generic (hint, hint :-)

I dont think that virtio-scsi will replace virtio-blk everywhere. For non-scsi
block devices, image files or logical volumes virtio-blk seems to be the right 
approach, I think.

I dont consider virtio-blk broken. It just doesnt cover everything.
