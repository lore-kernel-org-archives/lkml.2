Okay cool.  Here's the fix with a proper changelog and a little 
use-after-free paranoia.

Thanks!

Subject: [PATCH] Btrfs: clear current->journal_info on async transaction commit

Normally current->jouranl_info is cleared by commit_transaction.  For an
async snap or subvol creation, though, it runs in a work queue.  Clear
it in btrfs_commit_transaction_async() to avoid leaking a non-NULL
journal_info when we return to userspace.  When the actual commit runs in
the other thread it won't care that it's current->journal_info is already
NULL.
