Thanks for this report, I missed this patch. I thought the reason for the lack
of scsi_cmd_blk_ioctl() it was one of the differences between 2.6.27 and 2.6.32,
so I have adapted the callers I identified to perform the same test as what's
in scsi_cmd_blk_ioctl(). I *think* I did it correctly, but it would be safer
to apply the original patch, of course. Now I see the patch (618 in my queue).
 I'll merge it and it will simplify the backport.

Thank you,
Willy
