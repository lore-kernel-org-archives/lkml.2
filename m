I agree that a default of CFQ still makes sense for SATA and USB.

But why can't there be multiple defaults?

default: deadline
SATA and USB default: cfq

Just because server admins are more used to tuning doesn't mean all
server admins do it -- especially not on first evaluation.

There are distro packages that are shipped to control such knobs,
e.g. tuned.

They don't help _at all_ if the user doesn't know about them.  Knob
tuning is tedious on multiple levels.  Much like this thread ;)
