When mounting /x/y/c in your example above, the NFSv4 protocol requires
the client itself to resolve the symlink, and then walk down /a/b/c
(looking up component by component), so it will in practice not see
anything other than /a/b/c.

If it walks down to a referral, and then calls nfs_do_refmount, it will
do the same thing: obtain a path /e/f/g on the new server, and then walk
down that component by component while resolving any symlinks and/or
referrals that it crosses in the process.

Cheers
