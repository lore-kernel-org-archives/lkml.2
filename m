PS:
Entirely independently of this, it is important to remember that sr has
been and still is broken WRT hot removal/ hot unbinding of devices.

I haven't tried the last proposed patches from Jun'ichi Nomura or from Bart
Van Assche yet.  While I tested my BKL-replacement-removal patch, I made
sure to quit all processes that accessed /dev/sr*, including udisks-daemon,
every time before I unplugged a CD-ROM drive.  Or actually /almost/ every
time; sometimes I missed to kill udisks-daemon but was lucky enough not to
hit that bug in these sessions.
