Agreed.

Sounds correct.

Give me a few days to look at that. IMHO my patch fixes the bug (see the
comment below), which was an emergency at work. Coding an improved fix is
lower priority :)

You're right that I forgot about de_thread(). However, de_thread() does not
replace a task pid with an arbitrary other pid. The new pid lives in the sa=
me
pid namespaces, so that proc_flush_task() will call mntput() on the same
proc_mnts as the ones on which proc_new_task() called mntget().

Thanks,
