It synchronizes everyone calling pci_block_cfg_access + sysfs access. So
this is no cosmetic renaming but something that reflects the key change
in the semantics IMO.

As explained above, there is a strong relation between behavioral change
and API renaming in my eyes.

I'm open for a better suggestion that summarize the more verbose (and

Yes, will clean up.

OK, also for all futher remarks.
