Will you please piss off with your insinuations that we do not
Understand English? While it may not be our first language it does not
mean we are having trouble with it.

Haven't you noticed yet that not every maintainer uses git? USB, driver
core, tty, staging and i2c subsystems are based on quilt queues.
Media/DVB main tree is in mercurial. AOE is quilt. And I am pretty sure
there are others, I just don't care about them. And if you prefer to use
git - there are SVN and other importers - please use them.

I do not think that LIO is any bigger in scope than USB, I2C and others.

No, we should not be comparing SCMs at all here but rather 2 competing
implementations based on quality of the code. You tried to bring SMC
angle in and I am saying that it is BS.
