Thanks Ted, I'll take a look at xfstests and run them next time before
sending out v2.

Hmm, I thought the whole DIO workqueue would be flushed so I do not have
to do anything. I'll take a look.

Sure, that's fine.

But I wonder, since this is cross-FS story, where I need to first do
small VFS change (export the variable), then change all file-systems,
and then remove whole 's_dirt'/'write_supers()' stuff from VFS, how this
would be handled?

IMO, the best way would be to make everything go in via one single tree,
granted I could get all the acks, do you feel like ext4 tree could be
the one?

Also, I am working on top of vanilla 3.3, do you prefer me to work with
your tree instead? I guess this tree:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git

but which branch?
