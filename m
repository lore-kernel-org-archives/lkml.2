"Resetting the UUID on btrfs isn't a quick-and-easy thing - you have to
walk the entire tree and change every object. We've got a bad-hack in
meego that uses btrfs-debug-tree and changes the UUID while it runs
the entire tree, but it's ugly as hell."

That's on an unmoutned fs. Doing it on a mounted one seems more
complicated wrt to the intermediate state when there are some blocks
with the old and some block wit the new UUID. The operation will take
long and I don't know if it's better do to do it in batches (and
follow usual rules for commiting a transaction every now and then), or
in one go (requires: no failures, no scrub run, no devices
added/removed). Counting all potential problems and practical
unusability of the FS during UUID change, the off-line approach seems a
better way to go.
