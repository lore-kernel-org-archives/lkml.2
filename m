Hi,

I have a system with a Supermicro X9SCM (Intel C204 chipset) motherboard
and three Supermicro AOC-SAS2LP-MV8 controllers.

The AOC-SAS2LP-MV8 is based on the newer Marvell 88SE9485 controller,
which supports 8 channels of 6Gb/s SAS.  The `9485 is natively an 8x
PCI-E device.  This card is supported only in the latest 3.0/3.1.0-rc
kernels.  I am running 3.1.0-rc7.

The motherboard has 2 x8 PCI-E slots and 2 x4 PCI-E slots.  The `9845
in the x4 PCI-E slot consistently gets storms of errors from the mvsas
driver under heavy I/O, usually resulting in a drive getting kicked.

The cards in the x8 PCI-E slots work fine.  Under light I/O (moving or
copying small files) the x4 card is OK, but starting an md raid check
or rebuild operation or sustained large file copy dies in 2-3 minutes.

I have tried every combination I can think of, removing all but one card 
and then trying each of the 3 cards in both x8 and x4 slots.

There may be some flaw in my experiment, but as far as I can tell,
the only time I get errors is in the x4 slot.

These errors usually take the form of:

This seems like an fairly specific, configuration dependent problem.

I assume this is supported (x8 controller in x4 PCI-slot) and should
"just work", but I don't have any confirmation one way or the other.

Can any one tell me if this should or shouldn't work?  Any suggestions
for a fix?  I am willing to test patches or step through code to debug
this if someone can give me a pointer to get started.

Thanks,
John.
