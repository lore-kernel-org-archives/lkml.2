I have to notice, that it's not enough and doesn't solve the issue.
There should be some way how to connect/bind already existent unix 
socket (from kernel, at least), because socket can be created in user space.
And this way (sock operation or whatever) have to provide an ability to 
lookup UNIX socket starting from specified root to support containers.
