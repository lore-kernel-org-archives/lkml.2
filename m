I would argue this is an excellent reason not to merge this. This really
is in the camp of lets paper over shitty userspace instead of fix it.

Such a scheme takes away the immediate need to fix crap and therefore
crap will not get fixed. Why not focus on creating tools (I think
powertop really already does everything you need) and track down WTF
apps are firing so many timers when the screen if off.

Also, the downside of your approach is that you treat all applications
the same, what if there is a genuine need for reasonable timer response
and your 'policy' wrecks things?
