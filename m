Hey, Frederic.

Yes, that may be a solution but to "guarantee" that the limit is never
breached, we need to stop it first somehow.  Probably making freezing
the default behavior with userland notifier (inotify event should
suffice) should do, which we can't do now. :(

Well, yes and no.  While maintaining userland ABI is very important,
its importance isn't infinite and there are different types of
userland ABIs.  We definitely don't want to screw with syscalls.  We
should keep userland visible dynamic files which are used by common
usertools stable at almost all costs.  When it comes over to system
interface which is used mostly by base system tools, it can be a bit
flexible.  If the ABI in question is an optional thing, we probably
can be slightly more flexible.

We of course can't change things drastically.  It should be done
carefully with rather long deprecation period, but it can be done and
in fact isn't too uncommon.  Stuff under /sysfs tends to be somewhat
volatile and sysfs itself went through several ABI incompatible
iterations.

So, we can transition in baby steps.  e.g. we can first implement
proper nesting behavior without changing the default behavior and then
the base system can be updated to mount and control all subsystems by
default (with configuration opt-outs) so that the hierarchy reflects
pstree, effectively driving people away from multiple hierarchies and
we can implement new features assuming the new structure.  After a few
years, the kernel can start whining about non-start hierarchies and
then eventually remove the support.  It's a long process but
definitely doable.

Heh, yeah, this would be closer to the proper way to achieve
multi-attach but I can't help feeling that this just buries ourselves
deeper into s*it and we're already knee-deep.  If multiple hierarchies
is an essential feature, maybe, but, if it's not, and I'm extremely
skeptical that it is, why the hell would we want to go that way?

Hmmm?  Don't follow why this is relevant.

Thanks.
