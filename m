The posix acl mapping that samba and nfsd currently have to do is
painful for everyone and I'm delighted to get away from it.

My main remaining worry (besides the fact that cifs/v4 acls are too
complicated--but what can we do about that?)--is about how exactly the
(acl, mask)->acl mapping is going to work for nfsd and samba.

If we assume that filesystems are going to mostly use acls or mostly
mode bits, then maybe that part doesn't matter a whole lot.  I don't
know.
