Well, to be honest, that's what people wanted when the issue was raised
at LSF10.  However, unlike net, storage has never had a single
maintainer, so it's a bit more political than just doing that by fiat,
plus not all of the current maintainers with storage trees were there.
So we agreed (reluctantly) to start with an automatic tree and see how
much of the current problem that solved.  If the automatic tree turns
out not to be very useful, we can revisit the idea of a storage
maintainer.

The reason for being storage only rather than saying just use linux-next
(which was mentioned) is that next is a much bigger tree, so it's harder
to follow.  The diffs to mainline in the current storage tree are still
under a megabyte.
