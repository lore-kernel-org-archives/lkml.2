Thanks for doing that.

I suspect that problem is that "do_sync" and "do_barriers" in
drivers/md/raid1.c are still 'bool' and should now be 'unsigned long'.

I'm not sure how wide '_Bool' is, but I'm guess it isn't wide enough.

Could you please try changing ever 'bool' in that file to 'unsigned long'
and see if that fixes it?

Thanks,
NeilBrown
