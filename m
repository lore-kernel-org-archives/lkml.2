Subject: [PATCH 3/6] direct-io: do not merge logically non-contiguous requests
Date: Fri, 21 May 2010 13:03:39 -0400

Btrfs cannot handle having logically non-contiguous requests submitted.  For
example if you have

Logical:  [0-4095][HOLE][8192-12287]
Physical: [0-4095]      [4096-8191]

Normally the DIO code would put these into the same BIO's.  The problem is we
need to know exactly what offset is associated with what BIO so we can do our
checksumming and unlocking properly, so putting them in the same BIO doesn't
work.  So add another check where we submit the current BIO if the physical
blocks are not contigous OR the logical blocks are not contiguous.
