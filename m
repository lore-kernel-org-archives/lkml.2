I haven't seen any techinical discussion from you either.

all I see is how your favorite has been blessed as being the next thing to 
be included, even though it still needs work and Vlad's can't even be 
looked at.

that's hardly a technical discussion.

Vlad seems to be trying to document features of the different options, 
naturally he knows his option better than anyone else's. He offered to 
correct his listing with any information provided by anyone else, and 
instead of corrections to the feature lists, we just got accusations of 
handwaving and a reiteration that your favorite was selected in some 
meeting to be merged.

I would like to point out that over the years there have been many things 
that were expected to be merged that didn't get merged. Don't take any 
statement in any meeting to be a final decision. It doesn't matter how 
promising yourcode looked at that point in time, until it's merged you may 
find that it doesn't get merged. And even after it gets merged, if someone 
else has better code, their code may replace yours if the other code is 
better.

As a user, I would sure like to see more information about the two major 
choices and a lot less "this is what was picked at an invitation-only 
meeting where one option wasn't represented"
