Jan Kara helped convince me this might be better than fs-specific
fallthrus and whiteouts.  See my email on get_unlinked_inode().

The problem with hard links is that you run into hard link limits.  I
don't think we can do hard links for whiteouts and fallthrus.  Each
whiteout or fallthru will cost an inode if we implement them as
extended attributes.  This cost has to be balanced against the cost of
implementing them as dentries, which is mainly code complexity in
individual file systems.

Perhaps we can simply not interpret the whiteout/fallthru extended
attributes when the file system is not unioned and let userland
operate on them via getxattr()/setxattr().

It would certainly be more extensible than in-dentry flags.
