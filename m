  Umm, I kind of like this solution for ext3...

  This means that NEED_BOUNCE_POOL is going to be enabled on pretty much
any distro kernel...

... so might might_snapshot_stable_page_write() will be true for each
write. And thus blk_queue_bounce() becomes considerably more expensive?
Also calling should_snapshot_stable_pages() for every page seems to be
stupid since its result is going to be the same for all the pages in the
bio (well, I could imagine setups where it won't be but do we want to
support them?).

So cannot we just make a function like should_snapshot_stable_pages() to
test whether we really need the bouncing, use it in blk_queue_bounce() and
then pass the information to __blk_queue_bounce() if needed?
