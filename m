Yes, with the default value of inode_readahead_blks LA went from 4 to 30
(if I remember correctly). The problem was the increased load on HDD.

The hardware is: Core2duo CPU, 4GB RAM, 4x80GB SATA disks without NCQ,
the load is evenly distributed on the disks. At that time each disk
contained 1 million files, randomly accessed for read/create-write,
10MB/s read and 10MB/s write (rate sum of 4 disks).

Sure, with inode_readahead_blks=1 it works acceptably. But I'd like
to disable the inode read-ahead completely.

I think it is logical to be able to disable an unneeded feature.
Besides, there is a code already to check s_inode_readahead_blks!=0
(fs/ext4/inode.c:4737):

                /*
                 * If we need to do any I/O, try to pre-readahead extra
                 * blocks from the inode table.
                 */
                if (EXT4_SB(sb)->s_inode_readahead_blks) {
