I just realized that I confused things.  He's doing a read on the
results of a cp -a to a fresh FS, so there's no way the compiler/linker
are causing trouble.

The part I don't think any of us have solved is writing back the files
in a good order after we've fallocated the blocks.

So this will probably be great for reads and not so good for writes.

mkfs for defrag ;)  It's the only way to be sure.

acp does have a -b mode where it fibmaps (I was either lazy or it is
older than fiemap, I forget) the first block in the file, and uses that
to sort.  It does help if the file blocks aren't ordered well wrt their
inode numbers, but not if the files are fragmented.

It's also worth mentioning that acp doesn't actually cp.  I never got
that far.  It was supposed to be the perfect example of why everything
should be done via aio, but it just ended up demonstrating that ordering
by inode number and leveraging kernel/hardware reada were more
important.
