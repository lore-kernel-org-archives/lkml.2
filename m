Umm.

I think your argument is totally braindead and wrong.

My counter-argument is very simple: "So what?"

Those mm_structs are small. They are something like a couple of
hundred bytes. If you really worry about open files, you should worry
about the size of the inode, and people using the "pipe()" system
call. Then you have those open files with an inode, *and* several kB
of data that can be trivially filled by the user with a simple
"write()" that they never need read.

So "struct mm_struct" is totally irrelevant, and not in any way a
special thing. It's not the biggest, it's not the most interesting,
and it's simply not interesting. You're barking up the wrong tree.

None of it has anything to do with 'struct mm_struct', though, has it?

I suspect the real thing to do is to just make the OOM killer look at
how many files are open too. Make each open file count as 4kB (or
more), and use it when deciding what to kill. Fix the actual real
problem instead of trying to fix one small detail - and one that isn't
even the right small detail.
