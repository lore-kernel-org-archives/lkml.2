Let me quote back your previous message

	"Allow a proprietary non-GPL multipath driver, like EMC
	PowerPath, to detach a scsi_dh using scsi_dh_detach."

what part of that isn't about proprietary drivers.

They can submit the powerpath code to the GPL kernel and it can get dealt
with nicely.

No. I'm just reminding you and Red Hat that the kernel is subject to the
GPLv2 licence and that adding/removing _GPL from a symbol doesn't
magically allow you to use proprietary modules as you claim.

Thats unfortunate. You mean your company has been intentionally
leaving the Linux kernel poorer for the sake of dubious proprietary
code ?

You might want to stop digging, or at least use a spade not an excavator.

I suspect it is already a derived work, but right now that's their
problem. You are making it yours as well.

I'm a rights holder. Domain expertise isn't relevant here. The code I
provided is licensed under the GPL. Whether the symbol is EXPORT_SYMBOL
or EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL any derivative code (eg code that requires the
kernel be modified to match it) cannot call it.

I'm recommended by my lawyer to always remind people of this when such a
claim is made. It ensures that triple damages for wilful infringement
will apply unless the other party can show it reviewed the situation
carefully and its appropriately qualified legal staff reached a different
conclusion.

Obviously what action you take is up to Red Hat's legal (and PR) folks.
However I'd suggest you talk to them first, as per Red Hat training
unless that has changed..
