Not sure what version it was anymore as some time has passed. I think Bob was
supposed to do one more round of polishing the code and resend it.

I don't know, I haven't looked at that problem. I suspect it moved because that
was the easiest solution. Having an identical impl. of crc32(only the table values differ)
in crypto compared to the one in lib is not the way forward though.

Could not someone on the cc list weigh in here? I have no formal right to
demand anything, I am just expressing my opinion.
