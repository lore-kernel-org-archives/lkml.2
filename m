Yeah.  I think for this to happen is has to be evolutionary,
and the proposal above looks like a reasonable first crack at it.

I'm not sure about the issues on "adapting the block layer" ?
For FITRIM, the blocks being trimmed would be reserved at the fs level,
before issuing the discard for them.  So ordering through the block layer
shouldn't matter much for it.  Does that simplify things?

I see FITRIM just allocating a page to hold the ranges (for the >1 case)
and passing that page down through the layers to libata (or any other
LLD that supports >1 ranges).

??
