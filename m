(from the head message)
These patches are on top of

  block#for-2.6.36-post (c047ab2dddeeafbd6f7c00e45a13a5c4da53ea0b)
+ block-replace-barrier-with-sequenced-flush patchset[1]
+ block-fix-incorrect-bio-request-flag-conversion-in-md patch[2]

and available in the following git tree.

[1] http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1022363
[2] http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1023435

Probably fetching the git tree is the easist way to review?

With the patch applied, there's no second flush.  Those requests would
now be REQ_FLUSH + REQ_DISCARD.  The first can't be avoided anyway and
there won't be the second flush to begin with, so I don't think this
worsens anything.

Yeah, I think it would be enough to always advertise FLUSH|FUA if the
member devices support FLUSH (regardless of FUA support).  The reason
why I didn't do it was, umm, laziness, I suppose.

Yeap, I want you to be concerned. :-) This was the first time I looked
at the dm code and there are many different disjoint code paths and I
couldn't fully follow or test all of them, so it definitely needs a
careful review from someone who understands the whole thing.

I'll try to explain it.  If you have any further questions, please let
me know.

* For common part (dm-io, dm-log):

  * Empty REQ_HARDBARRIER is converted to empty REQ_FLUSH.

  * REQ_HARDBARRIER w/ data is converted either to data + REQ_FLUSH +
    REQ_FUA or data + REQ_FUA.  The former is the safe equivalent
    conversion but there could be cases where ther latter is enough.

* For bio based dm:

  * Unlike REQ_HARDBARRIER, REQ_FLUSH/FUA doesn't have any ordering
    requirements.  Remove assumptions of ordering and/or draining.

    A related question: Is dm_wait_for_completion() used in
    process_flush() safe against starvation under continuous influx of
    other commands?

  * As REQ_FLUSH/FUA doesn't require any ordering of requests before
    or after it, on array devices, the latter part - REQ_FUA - can be
    handled like other writes.  ie. REQ_FLUSH needs to be broadcasted
    to all devices but once that is complete the data/REQ_FUA bio can
    be sent to only the affected devices.  This needs some care as
    there are bio cloning/splitting code paths where REQ_FUA bit isn't
    preserved.

  * Guarantee that REQ_FLUSH w/ data never reaches targets (this in
    part is to put it in alignment with request based dm).

* For request based dm:

  * The sequencing is done by the block layer for the top level
    request_queue, so the only things request based dm needs to make
    sure is 1. handling empty REQ_FLUSH correctly (block layer will
    only send down empty REQ_FLUSHes) and 2. propagate REQ_FUA bit to
    member devices.

Thanks.
