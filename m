I've took both on tests. The subject is acp and spd_readdir used with
tar, all on ext4:
1) acp: http://91.234.146.107/~difrost/seekwatcher/acp_ext4.png
2) spd_readdir: http://91.234.146.107/~difrost/seekwatcher/tar_ext4_readir.png
3) both: http://91.234.146.107/~difrost/seekwatcher/acp_vs_spd_ext4.png

The acp looks much better than spd_readdir but directory copy with
spd_readdir decreased to 52m 39sec (30 min less).
