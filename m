So far it has been a one time deal here,
but stuff like this is pretty serious nonetheless.

I suppose it could also happen if another thread did a list-delete
at the same time as that function was running.  Which would require
that there be a locking bug/confusion somewhere.

Looking over the code, most places use rcu to protect accesses,
except for the fragment that crashed.  That's probably just fine,
but something to reexamine just out of paranoia.

Also, the spinlock pointer appears to be dynamic, one of two
possible spinlocks.  Maybe something got confused there
(well, obviously *something* got confused, so..).

Tough nut to crack, but if I saw strangeness like this again
I'd get really concerned about the state of our top grade filesystems
(had an XFS crash recently on a totally different machine).

I'll poke a bit more, looking specifically at recent ext4 changes.

Thanks Ted.
