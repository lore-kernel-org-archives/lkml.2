OK, got patch 1/3 successfully, but after I apply it, this one doesn't
apply:

jejb@mulgrave:~/git/scsi-misc-2.6> patch -p2 < ~/tmp.diff
patching file drivers/scsi/arcmsr/arcmsr.h
Hunk #9 succeeded at 599 with fuzz 2.
Hunk #10 FAILED at 619.

This rejection, for instance is because there's an indent before the
#else and #endif in the patch which isn't in the file ... that lack of
indent dates back to the time the driver was first imported, so you
can't be patching from the current kernel to this.

Can you redo 2/3 and 3/3 so they apply in sequence on 2.6.35-rc3 with
1/3 already applied?

Thanks,
