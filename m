Let's just think hard about what windows can actually be closed versus
how much effort goes in to closing them. I also prefer not to accept
half-solutions in the kernel because they don't want to implement real
solutions in hardware (it's pretty hard to checksum and protect all
kernel data structures by hand).

For "normal" writes into pagecache, the data can get corrupted anywhere
from after it is generated in userspace, during the copy, while it is
dirty in cache, and while it is being written out.

Closing the while it is dirty, while it is being written back window
still leaves a pretty big window. Also, how do you handle mmap writes?
Write protect and checksum the destination page after every store? Or
leave some window between when the pagecache is dirtied and when it is
written back? So I don't know whether it's worth putting a lot of effort
into this case.

If you had an interface for userspace to insert checksums to direct IO
requests or pagecache ranges, then not only can you close the entire gap
between userspace data generation, and writeback. But you also can
handle mmap writes and anything else just fine: userspace knows about
the concurrency details, so it can add the right checksum (and
potentially fsync etc) when it's ready.

And the bounce-retry method would be sufficient to handle IO
transmission errors for normal IOs without being intrusive.
