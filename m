Ok, fair point. I looked at how we could ensure it could never happen but
that would require failing sk_clear_memalloc() and it's less clear how
that should be properly recovered from. Instead, it can be detected that
there are rmem tokens allocations, warn about it and fix it up albeit it
in a fairly heavy-handed fashion. How about this on top of the existing
patch?
