thanks for the pointers.

does this value change depending on the number of disks in the array?

if mkfs.xfs can figure out how to do the 'right thing' for md raid arrays, 
can there be a mode where it asks the users for the same information that 
it gets from the kernel?

the problem with this is that for large arrays, formatting the array and 
loading it with data can take a day or more, even before you start running 
the test. This is made even worse if you are scaling up an existing system 
a couple orders of magnatude, because you may not have the full workload 
available to you. Saying that you should test out every option before 
going into production is a cop-out. The better you can test it, the better 
off you are, but without knowing what the knobs do, just doing a test and 
twiddling the knobs to do another test isn't very useful. If there is a 
way to set the knobs in the general ballpark, then you can test and see if 
the performance seems adaquate, if not you can try teaking one of the 
knobs a little bit and see if it helps or hurts. but if the knobs aren't 
even in the ballpark when you start, this doesn't help much.
