Yup, I figured as much. That's the reason I didn't ask you to swap the
meaning of the ratio values.

Much better! nit: I don't know if _pct is obvious to everyone but it only
takes 4 more characters to make it so..

I considered this but didn't like the idea of relying on it. More below.

I was thinking that with the lock held you can check the state variable
and just do the "opposite" of what it indicates:

	state		TODO
	FROZEN		THAWED
	FREEZING	THAWED
	THAWED		FROZEN

Then you don't need the separate bit to indicate which state it should
try to change to next.

But those windows could be pretty large if you delay it that long and
that could be confusing. With the lock will it be delayed?

Well you just need to acquire the spin lock when you enter the timer
function, calculate delay_jiffies and goal state without the need for
the freeze_thaw field, then drop the lock.

At that point you can initiate the state change and then do the
schedule_delayed_work().

Nope. Then you will have "negative" sleeps in the timer function which
just begs for misinterpretation. For example, look at msleep -- it takes an
unsigned int. This coupled with the race is a recipe for an unintended
long sleeps.

We don't need special values here -- just the enabled flag. When
enabled you can report the ratio from the ratio field. When not enabled
you can report the ratio by looking at the freezer state (might
want to do an update_if_frozen() first). Or you could just have writes
to the freezer.state always update the ratio. You don't need to vary
period_pct_ms at all when enabling/disabling the duty ratio.

That way at all times the values reported to userspace are consistent,
there are no "special" values, and writes to either file trigger the
correct changes between enabled/disabled and freezer state. For example
you might do:

$ echo 0 > freezer.frozen_time_pct
$ cat freezer.state
THAWED
$ cat freezer.frozen_time_pct
0
$ echo 100 > freezer.frozen_time_pct
$ cat freezer.state
FREEZING
$ cat freezer.state
FROZEN
$ cat freezer.frozen_time_pct
100
$ echo THAWED > freezer.state
$ cat freezer.frozen_time_pct
0

Hmm, OK I suppose.

Actually the tricky part to document has nothing to do with the
value of frozen_time_pct being 0 or 100. It has everything to do with
which write happened "last".

For all freezer.state values the value that should be read from
freezer.frozen_time_pct depends on whether it's due to a write to
freezer.frozen_time_pct or freezer.state. Writes directly to
freezer.frozen_time_pct should show what was written (if it's in 0-100
inclusive). Writes to freezer.state should appear to modify
freezer.frozen_time_pct to be consistent.

That's easily managed within the respective write functions.
Alternately, the read function for freezer.frozen_time_pct could check
the enabled bit and use that to switch which method it uses to
"read" the value.

Note how the period has nothing to do with any of this. It's just
a timescale factor which ensures there's a maximum frequency at which
we can change between FROZEN and THAWED (soon to be 1HZ).

Sounds good.

Something to look into: you might even be able to factor this chunk to
share it between both cgroup file write functions.
