The problem here is that it keeps a pid in a global list.  This list is
then browsed by all namespaces.  Looking into the code, I see 2 real
problems (didn't check, though):

1) If there are 2+ pid namespaces, one listener in pid_ns #1 and some
process dies in pid_ns #2, then the dying task wouldn't find the
listener via find_task_by_vpid() and would just delete the listener from
listeners list.  Looks like this problem was created by optimization
patch f9fd8914c1acca0.

2) Netlink sockets are per net namespace, but this accounting thing is per
pid namespace.  So, if the dying task and the listener are in a single
pid namespace, but in different net namespaces, the message will not be
sent via genlmsg_unicast().  I suspect it is a problem of all non-net
netlink sockets.
