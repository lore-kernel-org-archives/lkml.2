Just an anecdote, but I remember giving a talk to a room full
of admins, all of whom told me it was essential for Samba to
implement "full Windows ACL compatibility" (we were in the process
of coding it up at the time). I asked them to tell me the difference
between object inherit, container inherit, and inherit only. Only
one hand remained up (out of a room containing a couple of hundred
Windows admins). I asked him where he worked, and the reply was
"the US Marine Corps." :-).

Yeah. I think most sites set a group as the owner of a share
and the directory so exported, set the directory to inherit
everything down below, and just leave it up to the members
of that group without getting further involved :-).
