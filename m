Sorry, but I miss the logic.  Why do you think it's better to leave the
known unsecure defaults and rely on distros fix the permissions?  Why
not restrict it to the secure defaults and leave the decision who to
trust (i.e. all users, only current user, nobody) to distros?  The
decision has to be done either way, but in the 1st case the harm of lack
of chmod is much more significant.

No, I see the precise counters:

S=''; while :; do N=`stat -L /dev/pts/3 | sed -n 5p`; [ "$N" != "$S" ] && echo "$N"; S=$N;  done

Sure, we cannot remove atime/mtime from struct stat for ttys, but we can
leave these fields zero (or equal to any const sane date) if we know
that the tty owner and the process belong to different security domains
(euid check or smth. like may_ptrace()).  The quesion here is: are there
users of checking time counters of _foreign_ ttys?  If no, leaving these
counters blank will not break anything.

/proc/$PID/* will certainly benefit from revoke() - all ptrace check
could be made at open time, not on every read()/write() invocation.

/proc/* will benefit from revoke() if the permission logic is
implemented as Linus wants to see it - as dynamically re-chown'ed files,
which invalidate old fds on re'chown.

tty issue is indeed unrelated, sorry for the confusion.

Thanks,
