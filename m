I doubt it's anything special about that workload, but just for kicks I
tried a "git clone -ls" (cloning my linux tree to another directory on
the same nfs filesystem), with server on 3.6.0-rc7, and didn't see
anything interesting (just an xfs lockdep warning that looks like this
one jlayton already reported:
http://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2012-09/msg00088.html
)

Any (even partial) bisection results would certainly be useful, thanks.
