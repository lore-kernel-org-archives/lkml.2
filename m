Yes, UTF-16 should be used to indicate the change to UCS-2 to allow
4 byte encoding of some characters.  Currently with your patch we
have partial support for UTF-16 in cifs.ko, but most cifs (and smb2/smb3)
servers presumably support UTF-16 now on the wire.

It is in the for-next (and for-linus) branch.
