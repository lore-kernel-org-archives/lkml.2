Hm, uncharge_locked is not propagated to parent, I see.
Ok, it seems to work...but please add enough comment here. Or define
res_counter_move_parent().

ok, I'll go ahead in that way.

Ah, IIUC, this code is hugetlb version of mem_cgroup_move_parent().
At move_parent(), we don't need to take care of css counting because we're
moving from an exisiting cgroup to an cgroup which cannot be destroyed.
(move_account() is function to move account between arbitrary cgroup.)

So, yes, please remove comment.
