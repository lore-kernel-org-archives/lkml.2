Serge let me respectfully suggest that getting the user namespace done
will deal with this issue nicely.

In the simple case you simply won't be root so remount will just be
denied.

When/if we allow a limited form of unprivileged mounts in a user
namespace your user won't have mounted the filesystem so you should not
have the privilege to call remount on the filesystem.

I think I will have a set of patches ready for serious scrutiny in
the next week or so.  So we aren't talking impossible pie in the sky
distance to see this happen.

Eric
