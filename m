Just a point of clarification - when you say it is common and important to be
able to read the creation time on an existing file, and you still talking in
the context of cifs/smb windows compatibility, or are you talking in the
broader context?
If you are referring to a broader context could be please give more details
because I have not heard any mention of any real value of creation-time out
side of window interoperability - have such a use clearly documented would
assist the conversation I think.

If on the other hand you are just referring the the windows interoperability
context ... given that you have to read an EA if the create-time has been
changed, you will always have to read and EA so having something else is
pointless ... or I'm missing something.

Obviously if we were to make xattrs the preferred way to get create time out
of the filesystem we would want to make sure it is efficient.
It would seem to make perfect sense to add a 'getxattrat' syscall and allow an
AT_NONBLOCK flag (which would probably be useful for statat too).  The
AT_NONBLOCK flag would only get attributes if they were available immediately
without going to storage/network/whatever.

And if it is simply a case of too many syscalls per file, then
getxattrat_multi would seem to be the most general way to go.
