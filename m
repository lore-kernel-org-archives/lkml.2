Which means we exercise that code path, and ensure we have same_thread_group
test working properly.  Given how rare threaded inits are every little bit
of extra test coverage that doesn't really cost us anything seems important.

It is possible that other threads of a multi-threaded init are in the PF_EXITING
state and still visible for sending signals to.  I really don't want to send
SIG_KILL to another thread of init.  There is a chance of messing up the return
code if I do that, and do not want to need to think about that case.
