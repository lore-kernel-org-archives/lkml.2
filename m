Sorry, I should write "If all ancestors are umlimited'.
If parent is limited, the children should be treated as limited.

Personally, I think percpu counter is not the best one. Yes, it will work but...
Because of its nature of error range, it has scalability problem. Considering
to have a tree like

	/A/B/Guest0/tasks
             Guest1/tasks
             Guest2/tasks
             Guest4/tasks
             Guest5/tasks
             ......

percpu res_counter may work scarable in GuestX level but will conflict in level B.
And I don't want to think what happens in 256 cpu system. Error in B will be
very big.

Another idea is to borrow a resource from memcg to the tasks. i.e.having per-task
caching of charges. But it has two problems that draining unused resource is difficult
and precise usage is unknown.

IMHO, hard-limited resource counter itself may be a problem ;)

So, an idea, 'if all ancestors are unlimited, don't propagate charges.'
comes to my mind. With this, people use resource in FLAT (but has hierarchical cgroup
tree) will not see any performance problem.

If all ancestors are unlimited, we don't need to propagate usage upwards
at charging. If one of ancestors are limited, we need to propagate and
check usage at charging.

Seems enough and seems worth to try.

Another big problem is 'when' we should do this change..
Maybe this 'hierarchical' problem will be good topic in MM summit.
