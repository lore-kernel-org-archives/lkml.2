Simply having a flags field seems sufficient to me too. I don't think
we need padding, version or a size. Just make it a "rule" that if you
add a new field that it has to go at the end of the struct and a new
flag has to go with it. The kernel will need to only fill out fields
that are requested and that it knows about.

In the event that we approach running out of flags, we could even use
the last flag as a "HAS_FLAGS2" flag, to add a new flags field at the
end. Ugly, but it would avoid the need for a new syscall. We can kick
that potential problem down the road though. With 64 flags to play
with, it likely won't be a problem for a while.
