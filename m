Hi, Jan, thanks for the review!  I'm trying to figure out the best way
to relay the journal mode from ext3 or ext4 to jbd or jbd2.  Would a new
journal flag, set in journal_init_inode, be appropriate?  This wouldn't
cover the case of data journalling set per inode, though.  It also puts
some ext3-specific code into the purportedly fs-agnostic jbd code
(specifically, testing the superblock for the data journal mount flag).
Do you have any suggestions?

Thanks!
Jeff
