new_state is initialized false, and referenced otherwise only once,
when a reference ot is is passed here:

so if new_state is true, then lookup_or_create_lock_state() set it to
true.  But it sets that only in one spot, at the end:

	*new = true;
	return nfs_ok;

Note nfs_ok is zero.  Therefore:

> 4012                if (status)

this could not have happened.

So it looks like a Coverity bug.
