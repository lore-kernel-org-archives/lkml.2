NULL?  AFAICS, lease_alloc() returns ERR_PTR() on failure...  I really
don't like the look of that code, TBH - at the very least it needs to
be commented a lot.  E.g. the rules for calling or not calling ->lm_break()
are really not obvious - AFAICS, we do that if
	i_have_this_lease || (mode & O_NONBLOCK)
is true *or* if allocation has succeeded.  The former condition is what'll
end up with -EWOULDBLOCK; I can understand not wanting to return that in
preference to -ENOMEM, but...  Do we want to skip ->lm_break() stuff only
in case of allocation failures that won't be overridden by -EWOULDBLOCK?
