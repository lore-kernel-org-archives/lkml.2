Subject: [PATCH for 3.6 1/3] virtio-scsi: fix copying of sg_list in the presence of of HighMem pages

From: Wang Sen <senwang@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

On a 32-bit guest with virtio-scsi devices and more than 1G physical memory,
QEMU may crash or Linux will fail to boot.

This bug happens when building the sg_list that is eventually put in the virtqueue.
Each buffer from the original sg_list is added with sg_set_buf, but this will
not work for HighMem pages in table->sgl.  In that case, the original sg_list
elements do not have a valid virtual address, but sg_set_buf will use sg_virt.

For now, virtio_ring does not care about the form of the scatterlist and
simply processes the first out_num + in_num consecutive elements of the sg[]
array.  However, it is better to create a well-formed scatterlist including
the termination marker.

http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1207.3/00675.html discusses
using value assignment vs. sg_set_page to copy the scatterlist.

With sg_set_page, the driver would need to drop the marker manually in case
it was left there by a previous request, and then use sg_mark_end to add the
marker to the last entry.

Value assignment instead will copy the last entry of the source sg_list
to the destination list.  The end marker that were set by blk_rq_map_sg()
is copied too when the last entry of the source sg_list is copied to
the the last entry in destination list.
