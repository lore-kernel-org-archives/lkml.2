You are proving that I'm actually right ;). In the beginning of this 
thread I offered a transition path from STGT to SCST and James rejected 
it, because it didn't confirm a requirement that a new SCSI target 
infrastructure must be STGT ABI compatible. But latter James left this 
decision up to the STGT developers and now you are confirming that they 
don't see any ABI compatibility issues, so my transition path fully 
confirms all the requirements.

I'm not deciding anything, I'm only analyzing and seeing a contradiction:

1. James wants only one SCSI target infrastructure in the kernel.

2. If drivers/scsi/scsi_tgt_*.c left after the merge of the new SCSI 
target infrastructure, it would mean that STGT left as well => 2 SCSI 
target infrastructure in the kernel.

For me it doesn't matter. I just want clear rules, hence asking for 
clarification.

That's a nice, but quite meaningless LIO advertisement. SCST is using 
the same bisectable, distributed and reviewable workflow. If we had a 
kernel.org git account, we would use it as well, but so far we are happy 
with SF.net hosting. BTW, how was you able to get the git account 
without a single patch merged in the kernel? You must have good 
connections in the kernel community.

Can you list us benefits for an average user of that work?

I have sent patches twice, the second time few months ago. Weren't they 
human readable and accessible for kernel developers who are experts in 
dealing with sent by e-mail patches?

Thanks,
