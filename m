Yes, me too, thanks for doing this.

Give me a feel for this: If we put the driver in now, all cleanups
effectively get postponed until .41 (because they're no longer really
-rc candidates).  If the driver gets included in a .40-rc, we have a
couple more months to get the basic cleanups done.

Dan, where's the hardware release at ... as in how urgent is 39-rc last
vs .40 rc?

Right ... I'm happy with the basic progress so far.
