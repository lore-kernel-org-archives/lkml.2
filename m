I apologize for being blunt - but this is probably an issue specific to 
DMTCP's engineering...

What is a "local" socket ?  af_unix, or locally connected af_inet ?

Anyway, with linux-cr you'd do what's needed after the restarted tasks are
created, but before their state is restored. For each such "old" socket
that you want to replace, you'd create (in userspace with arbitrary glue" 
code!) a new socket, and use this socket when restoring the state of the
task. Similarly, you could replace any other resource, not only sockets.

Repainting during restart is the least of your problems.

Leak detection is not a problem: 
If the socket connects out of the containers (like af_inet) - then it is 
not a leak, andyou treat it as described above.
If the sockets connects within the container but you don't checkpoint the
"peer" process - then it is not a container-c/r (in which case you don't 
look for leaks).

Also, the application could mark resources to not be checkpointed (e.g. 
scratch memory to save storage, or sockets to not count as leaks).

I don't see any problem with X11 or any other library and "glue".

I explain again - in case it wasn't clear from my 3-part post: leak 
detection is relevant _only_ for full container-c/r. It doesn't make 
sense otherwise.

If you want to checkpoint individual components of an application,
then it's up to userspace to produce/provide the relevant "glue" to
make it "make sense" when those components restart without their 
original eco-system.

Thanks,

Oren.
