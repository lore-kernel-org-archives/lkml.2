I'm not judging the idea as good/bad, just providing information for
context.

If you can show this does not affect performance in benchmarks, etc, I'm
sure it will be easier to push the patch. As outside of performance, I
don't think there's much of an issue with the change.

So other then "show some numbers", my only thought that might make the
patch more attractive is that rather than a global change, or a static
CONFIG_ option, would it maybe make more sense as a mount option?
