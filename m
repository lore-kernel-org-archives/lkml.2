Yes, this is well known (if you search the scsi archives, you'll find
several previous reports).  It's harmless -- the only place it could hurt
is on ARM, and I've never heard of anyone plugging a sym2 card into an
ARM machine.

The fix would be quite involved, and the driver really isn't worth fixing
-- the hardware tops out at 160 MB/s which is an order of magnitude
lower performance than the hardware I'm currently working on.
