If all the clients unmount, and then you run "exportfs -f" on the
server, you'll probably find you can then unmount the export.

But stopping nfsd is the most reliable way to ensure you can unmount the
exported filesystems.  I'd recommend doing that using your distro's nfs
scripts (so "service nfs stop" or "systemctl nfs-server.service stop" or
equivalent) rather than killing nfsd yourself.
