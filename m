Those patches are working well for me, many thanks to Yongqiang.

The last (or more of them?) fix behaviour going back several
releases, and ought to be sent to -stable after verification.

I ran fsx (args as before on 1024k block ext2fs under memory pressure)
for 8 hours on three machines, and no problem showed up on any.
I didn't have time to try ext4, but I expect that you did.

And I've run kernel builds under memory pressure for 7.5 hours,
no problem has showed up there either - although that's not long
enough yet to validate the oops fix by itself, we've earlier run
long enough with the first 2/2 to be sure that it fixes the oops,
and the "corruption" that I saw.

Quotes around corruption now because, from Yongqiang's description,
I'm guessing that ld was mmap'ing objfiles and acting on "data"
from beyond eof.  Which ld does have the right to do, it should
indeed be zeroed.

Only once, before the fixes, did I ever see an unexplained EINVAL
(from cp), like Andy reports: I'm very hopeful his case is fixed too.

Thanks!
Hugh
