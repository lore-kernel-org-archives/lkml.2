Hmmm, good point.  I was trying to avoid doing this initially because it
adds more complexity when calling ->do_task() in target_core_transport.c
__transport_execute_tasks(), but I would agree the tradeoff here to make
IBLOCK, FILEIO and RAMDISK subsystem backend code SCSI control CDB
emulation independent is worth it.

Ok, I think this makes sense and should be easy enough for the cases
that have been listed here.  However, there are still cases (namely DIF)
that containing SCSI specific bits and would still be going into IBLOCK
and FILEIO.

Makes sense, I will drop struct se_subsystem_api_cdb, et al and post a
followup patch series this afternoon.

Thanks!
