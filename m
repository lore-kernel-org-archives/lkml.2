Yes it does. At least for SBC devices that are flagged as removable.
"Normal" SBC devices that are not removable might trigger different
behaviour in the kernel.
(endless string of TEST_UNIT_READY is a way to check if something
"unexpected" happens on the device.)

I just tested on a 3.0.0  kernel.

I have a mediachanger for SBC and the SBC is flagged as removable.
/dev/sdd is the iscsi lun with a removable SBC disk.

By just exposing this device to the kernel, the kernel keeps sending,
or if not the kernel maybe some other process trying to poll the
status?

every few seconds :
PREVENT_ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL  prevent removal
PREVENT_ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL  to immediatel change it back to allow
removal again
TEST_UNIT_READY


After I run this
mount /dev/sdd1 /mnt

The kernel sends a single
PREVENT_ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL to prevent removal
then every few seconds a
TEST_UNIT_READY


This is what it does for removable SBC disks. Maybe it does something
differently for "permanent" SBC disks.
