Hi Jan,

Not sure if this is relevant, but what we have been using for part of the 
testing is an external e-sata enclosure that you can stick pretty much any S-ATA 
disk into. Important to drop power to the external disk (do not pull the s-ata 
cable, the firmware will destage the write cache for some/many disks if it has 
power and sees link loss :)).

Once you turn the drive back on, the test was can you mount without error, 
unmount and do a fsck -f to verify no meta-data corruption,

Ric
