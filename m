This was found using a static code analysis tool (currently a PoC) which
is a part of a research project at our university.

And later, code inspection confirms that i_ctime updates can be disturbed.

I should have specified this. Sorry.

Actually I've grepped this ioctl but did not found use cases, but as
ext{3,2} also support it, I did not say anything (this is old, there is
even the EXT4_IOC_SETVERSION_OLD ioctl ?). I don't know if this ioctl is
used or not.

Only the reiserfs and ext{2,3,4} filesystems support this ioctl. The reiserfs
do not use mutexes at all, even in the REISERFS_IOC_SETFLAGS ioctl which will
test and set _all_ the possible values of the i_flags field.
Perhaps I should also send a patch for this ?

And perhaps ext2 should also be updated.

Thanks for the feedback.
