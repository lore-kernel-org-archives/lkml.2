An example use is where rcu_access_pointer() is legal because we are
either initializing or cleaning up, so that no other CPU has access
to the pointer.  In these cases, you might do something like:

	q = rcu_access_pointer(p->a, p->refcnt == 0);

Agreed on rcu_dereference_protected().  I succumbed to a fit of "make
the identifier shorter", please accept my apologies.

Yep, that the spinlock is held.  I agree that it is a bit obvious in
this case, but I have come across a number of RCU uses where the lock
in question was acquired many function calls removed from the access,
and where there other locks were held for other purposes.

I suggest something like the following:

		/* protected by double-check lock pattern. */
		if (rcu_access_pointer(nfsi->delegation, 1) != NULL) {
