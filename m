Yeah, I think we need that but there currently isn't any concrete (or
even floppy) plan for it.  If anyone is interested, beer is on me. :)

I probably have chosen the wrong word.  I mean that it's a hierarchy
management feature implemented at the wrong layer.  If we want to
provide cgroup migration locking, it should be implemented at the
cgroup core layer as a controller independent feature.  It's kinda
interesting the incorrect layering here almost directly caused messy
locking problem too.  I hope we don't need it with (the imaginary)
proper userland arbitration but even if we do implementing it in
cgroup proper as a separate feature would be a lot less messy.

Thanks.
