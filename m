Yes, I believe the obsolescence of atomicio.c from having taken the
conversion patch (patch 3/4 of the series) was inadvertent.  As such I
was trying to help by producing a series that addresses the two recent
additions to atomicio.c that needed ported over to osl.c so that we
would not loose such functionality with atomicio's obsolence as fast as
possible.  Linus may not allow such now that the 3.3 merge window is
closed but I think we all are thinking we should at least attempt to get
the regressions resolved immediately if possible.

I must admit, while I understand the reason and concept related to
handling RAM for APEI, I do not understand memory management well enough
understand the details of the original implementation.  I was just
trying to cross-port the functionality over.  In doing such, I too, was
concerned as to the asymmetric nature of the paths (mapping vs.
unmapping) with respect to x86 as it just *felt* wrong.

Len - please let me know if you want me to adjust the patch with Thomas'
suggestions.

Thanks Thomas - yes, the removal patch - 3/3 - is the same.
