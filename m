OK..sorry for missing that part!

But would you default to dirty_background_time=0, where the special
value 0 means no change of the original behavior? That will address
David's very reasonable concern. Otherwise quite a few users are going
to be surprised by the new behavior after upgrading kernel.

Yes.

Sure.
