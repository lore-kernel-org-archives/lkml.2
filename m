Ok, here's what I have so far.  I took everyone's suggestions of where to add
calls to wait_on_page_writeback, which seems to handle the multiple-write case
adequately.  Unfortunately, it is still possible to generate checksum errors by
scribbling furiously on a mmap'd region, even after adding the writeback wait
in the ext4 writepage function.  Oddly, I couldn't break btrfs with mmap by
removing its wait_for_page_writeback call, so I suspect there's a bit more
going on in btrfs than I've been able to figure out.

The set_memory_ro debugging trick didn't ferret out any write paths that I
didn't catch... though it did have the effect of causing occasional fsync()
deadlocks.  I suppose I could sprinkle in a few more of those write calls to
see what happens.

Either way, I'm emailing to ask everyone's advice since I've run out of ideas.
Or: Did I miss something?

Thanks all for the feedback so far!
