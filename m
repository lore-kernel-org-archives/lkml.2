Best would be if it didn't need any modification to filesystems.  All
this having to upgrade util-linux, e2fsprogs, having incompatible
filesystem features is a pain for users (just been through that).

What we already have in most filesystems:

 - extended attributes, e.g. use the system.union.* namespace and
   denote whiteouts and falltroughs with such an attribute

 - hard links to make sure a separate inode is not necessary for each
   whiteout/fallthrough entry

 - some way for the user to easily identify such files when not
   mounted as part of a union e.g. make it a symlink pointing to
   "(deleted)" or whatever

Later the extended attributes can also be used for other things like
e.g. chmod()/chown() only copying up metadata, not data, and
indicating that data is still found on the lower layers.
