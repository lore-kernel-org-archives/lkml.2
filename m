Yes.

I must disagree. The block layer has no more information than the SCSI
layer and lacks everything the lower layers know.

Actually they must not be suspended while they contain a medium,
lest you drive the GUI and the user mad.

It seems to me that most of these difficulties go away if we strictly
differentiate between host adapter and disks.

First, the sr driver cannot really suspend a disk. It can spin down a disk,
but that is not the same thing as suspending, because the disk is still
functional. It may just return special sense codes. The sr driver just
prepares devices for suspension.
It is true, that the sr driver probably does have a few conditions under
which a device should not be suspended (eg. error handling) but it
lacks positive knowledge about when we may suspend.

The same is also true for any higher layer.

The problem of needing to do IO for suspension goes away if we
treat the disk as always suspendable and use an active command
as a condition for not suspending the storage device as opposed to the disk
the problem goes away.
