When we add the dynamic non-resizable support, how would DEFINE_HASHTABLE() look?

Which macros do you consider as trivial within the current API?

Basically this entire thing could be reduced to DEFINE/DECLARE_HASHTABLE and
get_bucket(), but it would make the life of anyone who wants a slightly
different hashtable a hell.

I think that right now the only real trivial wrapper is hash_hashed(), and I
think it's a price worth paying to have a single hashtable API instead of
fragmenting it when more implementations come along.

Sasha
