Yes, this patches still have issues that Val and me are aware off. I can't
remember anything jffs2-specific though.

We return that inode number because we don't want to lookup the name on the
other filesystem during readdir. Therefore returning DT_UNKNOWN to let the
userspace decide if it needs to stat the file was the easiest workaround. I
know that POSIX requires d_ino and d_name but on the other hand it does not
require anything more on how long d_ino is valid.

If somebody has an idea how to make this cleaner please speak up.
