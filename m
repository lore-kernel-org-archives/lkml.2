These could be stored in the group flags, bg_flags, like the UNINIT bits.
Since the group descriptors are pinned in memory there is no need to
re-read the group (and fail) again.  If it is written to disk, then e2fsck
can clear it.

It would be nice, for the case of bitmap checksum errors at least that the
allocator just chose the next block group and continued on running, though
it should also mark the superblock error flag.

If things are so bad that the device is completely unreadable, all of the block
groups would quickly be marked in error and the filesystem is now aborted like
it would have been previously.

Hmm, I guess the only way that this might be hit is via memory corruption?
I never really thought about it.  I guess it isn't harmful to check, and in
case of an in-memory corruption, it does call ext4_error() and typically
marks the filesystem read-only.

For inode and block bitmaps, however, I've seen corruption in a lot of cases.
Sometimes the simple checks catch this, but having a proper checksum would be
a lot more reassuring.

Cheers, Andreas
