Well, this could be changed to pass the syscall number through
registers along to try_to_freeze without any mentionable performance
hit.

Re-using the assembly code or factoring it out so that it can be used
from multiple places doesn't seem very pleasing to me, as the assembly
code is in the critical path and written specifically for the context
of a process entering the kernel. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I imagine simply a function in C, more or less re-implementing the
logic that's already in entry-common.S, might do the trick. I wouldn't
worry much about the performance in this case as it will not be used
often. The following _untested_ snippet illustrates my idea:
