As a minor speed optimization, the htree checksum only covers the fake dirent
structures, the htree block header, and header.count dx_entry structs, which
means that in the common case it won't come anywhere close to checksumming all
4096 bytes.  But you do make a compelling case to cover that reserved field
even if it's zero now.

Ok.

Yes, that would make a nice (separate) cleanup patch.
