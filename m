This lightweight stat() interface is exactly needed for things like "color ls",
which is the default on all distros today.  "ls --color" always does a stat on the file just to get the file mode to color executable files differently.  For Lustre and other distributed filesystems, getting things like the current file size is hard work (i.e. multiple RPCs per file), yet "ls" doesn't care about the size or modification times unless "ls -l" is used.  Same goes for "find".

Having a readdirplus() syscall would be even better, but again only with the ability to request specific attributes.  Otherwise the filesystem may be doing a lot of extra work to collect all of the file attributes, and then userspace will probably be throwing most of them away.
