Are you referring to "[PATCH v6 05/10] crc32-misc-cleanup.diff" from 8/31?  I
haven't seen that one, so I'll go comb the internet.  Thank you for the
pointer, I'll update my patch.

> Start from Bobs latest patches and add crc32c to lib/crc32.c

If I did that, how should I handle patching in the hardware accelerated version
on Intel systems?  That switcheroo ability seems to have been Herbert Xu's
motivation for moving crc32c into crypto/ in the first place:

"libcrc32c: Move implementation to crypto crc32c

"This patch swaps the role of libcrc32c and crc32c.  Previously
the implementation was in libcrc32c and crc32c was a wrapper.
Now the code is in crc32c and libcrc32c just calls the crypto
layer.

"The reason for the change is to tap into the algorithm selection
capability of the crypto API so that optimised implementations
such as the one utilising Intel's CRC32C instruction can be
used where available."

> Also, for crc32c I think you only need slice by 4 and slice by 8

Yes.  The lookup table option is only for people with extremely small systems,
and the per-bit option is usable only for debugging.  They could go away if
anyone's really offended by them. :)
