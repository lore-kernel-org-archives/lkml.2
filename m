Yes, I think that nfs4_callback_version4 should also have vs_hidden
set. Currently, it's trying to unregister the service from the
portmapper on shutdown even though it's not registering it. Basically,
any service that sets up its sockets with SVC_SOCK_ANONYMOUS should
also have vs_hidden set on all versions.
