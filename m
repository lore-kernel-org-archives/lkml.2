No.  Each layer must be a separate file system, the bottom must be
read-only, the top must be writable, and they must be unioned at their
mount points.

All it takes is looking for the "union" string in the mount options.

Not as much as it deserves. :) Do you have any thoughts about better
solutions?

Something to keep in mind is that most of the app issues are already
present with bind mounts.  In many cases, if an app doesn't work with
union mounts, it's also not going to work with bind mounts.  I think
you have a good point that we could use a more straightforward way to
say, "Hey, you can't use the normal st_dev/st_ino rules right now..."
