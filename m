    dmesg | grep <alias>

seems a little bit problematic, because for example initial messages
for the device will be invisible. In the log will be messages with
original canonical names and another (later) messages with aliases, you
can also change the alias, etc. Seems like a mess. The log should be
consistent...

I think it would be better to use always only canonical names in the
kernel log and translate to something more user-friendly in userspace.
For example if you add some meta-information to the kernel log then we
can improve dmesg(1) to translate the canonical names to aliases.

 printk(KERN_INFO "this is info about %{device}s", device);

 <5>[105221.774534]{device=sda} this is info about sda

or whatever... (this is a nice topic with many colors for the bike
shed:-)

If you want to modify all the userspace utils then you don't have to
modify /proc/partitions :-)

You can keep the standard names in /proc/partitions (so the file will
be compatible with /sys and /dev) and you can modify all the utils to
translate the canonical device names to aliases. The result will be
the same, except "cat /proc/partitions" -- but I think that instead of
"cat" you can use "lsblk".

If you add only the attribute (alias name) to the /sys then you don't
have to care if all the utils are already modified.

Anyway, I still agree with Kay and Greg -- the proper solution
is to improve printk() and dmesg(1). The aliases could be implemented 
in userspace by udev /dev/disk/by-alias/<cool_name> symlinks.
