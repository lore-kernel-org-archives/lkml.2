This approach could work.  One way of doing it would be to add a second
argument:

static inline void *radix_tree_deref_slot_check(void **pslot, int ldc)
{
	void *ret = rcu_dereference_check(*pslot, ldc);
	if (unlikely(radix_tree_is_indirect_ptr(ret)))
		ret = RADIX_TREE_RETRY;
	return ret;
}

static inline void *radix_tree_deref_slot(void **pslot)
{
	return radix_tree_deref_slot_check(pslot, rcu_read_lock_held());
}

Another alternative would have radix_tree_deref_slot() pass "1" into
the "ldc" argument, which reduces splats but at the expense of failing
to detect problems.  ;-)
