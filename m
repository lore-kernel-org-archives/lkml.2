It's still giving the same rejections ... including the one I drew your
attention to in the header.  Either there's a patch missing somewhere,
or we're not working from the same base.  What I have is 2.6.35-rc3 plus
your patch 1/3 here

Message-id: <6D8C005181EA4A93BF2C281E4E1F72FC@areca4e4f859d4>

Let's try to come at this a different way since you don't seem to be
able to use git.  The current files I'm patching against are available
here (this includes your patch 1/3):

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi-misc-2.6.git;a=tree;f=drivers/scsi/arcmsr

You can download them directly from the web using the "raw" link.  Can
you make sure the patches you send apply cleanly to these files?
