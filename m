What an epic patchset.  I guess that saving a byte per printk does make
the world a better place, and forcibly ensuring that nothing is
dependent upon the internal format of the KERN_foo strings is nice.


Unfortunately the <n> thing is part of the kernel ABI:

	echo "<4>foo" > /dev/kmsg

devkmsg_writev() does weird and wonderful things with
facilities/levels.  That function incorrectly returns "success" when
copy_from_user() faults, btw.  It also babbles on about LOG_USER and
LOG_KERN without ever defining these things.  I guess they're
userspace-only concepts and are hardwired to 0 and 1 in the kernel.  Or
not.

So what to do about /dev/kmsg?  I'd say "nothing": we retain "<n>" as
the externally-presented kernel format for a facility level, and the
fact that the kernel internally uses a different encoding is hidden
from userspace.

And if the user does

	echo "\0014foo" > /dev/kmsg

then I guess we should pass it straight through, retaining the \0014. 
But from my reading of your code, this doesn't work - vprintk_emit()
will go ahead and strip and interpret the \0014, evading the stuff
which devkmsg_writev() did.
