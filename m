Yeah - there's two things here: one is the boot option to turn it on, 
the other is the kill-switch that is runtime and kills this method of 
access permanently (until next reboot that is).

the kill-switch works like modules_disabled: once you echo 1 into it 
you cannot move it back to 0 anymore.

The boot option would be a standard boot option - devmem=1 would be 
the canonical naming? (but no strong feelings about the naming)

Do you expect distros to enable this boot option by default? I.e. 
would SuSE be willing to ship with a restrictive /dev/mem by default? 
That's really the wider goal we want to work towards.

Hm, why would the ability "dirty and/or flush an arbitrary physical 
cache line for testing purposes" be a DoS?

Thanks,
