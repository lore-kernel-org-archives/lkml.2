This changelog is a bit misleading, isn't it?

The basic problem is that binary only third party drivers can't use the
scsi_dh_detach callback because it's GPL only.  The only module I know
which suffers this problem is powerpath, is that right?

So this patch actually relaxes our GPL only policy to allow powerpath to
detach correctly. I really don't like the characterisation in the
current proposed changelog of this being a "third party" problem because
quite a few third party modules actually provide source and are thus GPL
compliant.

The whole point of GPL only symbols is to make life difficult for binary
modules, so I could just say this might be indicative of the success of
that policy.  On the other hand, I'm not going to be religious about
this.  If you get the ack of the dh handler maintainer (Chandra
Seetharaman) I'll apply this policy relaxation with a proper changelog
that says what we're doing (allowing powerpath to bind to the symbol).
