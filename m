It mainly serves as an accelerator for existing stat/mtime checks,
though it does improve change detection in the last second or so since
a previous change, which with mtime you have to make pessimistic or
sometimes-incorrect assumptions.

Quite a few programs use inotify now because it saves a little power,
and is a bit more responsive than, say, polling config files with stat().

For reliable filesystem tracking across times when not listening,
especially if you don't trust the clock to have no backward steps (and
you should not), a lazy change count file attribute would do.  It's
been discussed but never implemented.

This thread has revealed quite a big hole, I agree.  Apps cannot even
use their normal filesystem-type whitelisting to catch this.  This is bad!

It is not the first hole that was found in inotify/dnotify, but it's
the first one I'm aware of that wasn't pointed out long ago and
then quietly ignored :-/

Designs get discussed from time to time, over the decades.

I think one of the reasons it doesn't go further is Al's well-known
objection -- why put the effort in if you know it will be rejected.
And a widespread view that it's just unimportant GUI file manager fluff.
The latter also means dependability issues have tended not to be taken
seriously.
