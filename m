I'll try to take a look soon, but I'm travelling tomorrow through the
31st, and things will be a little hectic.

Just one quick comment:

I suspect one reason it may be a little complicated is the
upcall-version switching.  The old version is deprecated, and there's no
need to support the combination of the old version with the a new
feature like containers.  And now that it's been there a while the
version-switching code already achieved its goal of avoiding a flag day.
So, one approach might be:

	- move all the code for the old gss upcall and for the version
	  switching under a new CONFIG_DEPRECATED_GSS, or similar.
	- print a warning if the old stuff is used, and plan to rip it
	  out completely in a future kernel version.
	- do something that works just in the !CONFIG_DEPRECATED_GSS
	  case.

Would that help?
