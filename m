Ah, okay. Thanks for the hint.

A few other locations that I can see that call igrab with inode->i_lock
held are:

  fs/ceph/snap.c::ceph_queue_cap_snap
  fs/ceph/addr.c::ceph_set_page_dirty
  fs/nfs/nfs4state.c::nfs4_get_open_state

There may be some more cases where the locking is less obvious. I don't
know enough about the filesystem code to say whether each of those can
skip the (I_FREEING | I_WILL_FREE) check, or whether the correct
approach is to modify the filesystems themselves so that they do not
hold i_lock when calling igrab (i.e. rework to use a different outer lock)?

If the correct approach is to use __iget or __igrab then I can prepare a
patch for this. In the case of __iget, should it just be marked
EXPORT_SYMBOL and added to include/linux/fs.h?
