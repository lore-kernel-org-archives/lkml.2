[All the below with a grain of salt, from my senile memory]

You must not forget some facts about the scatterlist received here at the LLD.
It has already been DMA mapped and locked by the generic layer.
Which means that the DMA engine has already collapsed physically-contiguous
entries. Those you get here are already unique physically.
(There were bugs in the past, where this was not true, please complain
 if you find them again)

A scatterlist is two different lists taking the same space, but with two
different length.
- One list is the PAGE pointers plus offset && length, which is bigger or
  equal to the 2nd list. The end marker corresponds to this list.

  This list is the input into the DMA engine.

- Second list is the physical DMA addresses list. With their physical-lengths.
  Offset is not needed because it is incorporated in the DMA address.

  This list is the output from the DMA engine.

  The reason 2nd list is shorter is because the DMA engine tries to minimize
  the physical scatter-list entries which is usually a limited HW resource.

  This list might follow chains but it's end is determined by the received
  sg_count from the DMA engine, not by the end marker.

At the time my opinion, and I think Rusty agreed, was that the scatterlist
should be split in two. The input page-ptr list is just the BIO, and the
output of the DMA-engine should just be the physical part of the sg_list,
as a separate parameter. But all this was berried under too much APIs and
the noise was two strong, for any single brave sole.

So I'd just trust blindly the returned sg_count from the DMA engine, it is
already optimized. I THINK
