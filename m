Thanks Amir!

You have to understand that I am still not convinced that ext4 snapshot
in its current state is really what we want to have in ext4. Especially
given the very basic features it provides, without any knowledge on how
it can be extended (but you're slowly providing that information, so
thanks for that). And especially facing the new dm-multisnap, I really
wonder if it is worth it.

If we want filesystem level snapshotting we can try to do it right with
all the benefits that snapshots on that level brings. But what I see
now, is not even remotely the case. And I have the feeling that all the
features that might be interesting for snapshotting at file system
level, are just a hack and not inherent from the design. But that is
probably because your goal was to snapshot the whole filesystem for the
backup purposes, but that's not what I would expect from fs level
snapshots. I really hope you understand my point.

And that is the problem. Because at this level you should be able to do
it without very much trouble, because being at file system level you
should have all the information. Do not get me wrong, I am not saying
that this is easy, but is should be "from design". Exporting the
"revert patch" to the external storage, or exporting snapshot to LVM
format to be able to merge it...that is all just hacks, because the
design itself does not count with that possibility.

Exactly, so if we want fs level snapshots, it should use that
privilege no hack its way to do things like roll back, or
excludes+includes. Ext4 was not meant to work that way, nor was your
snapshots designed to work that way. If we are considering backups only,
because that is what you ext4 snaphosts can provide now, I would prefer
to use LVM. But yes, we all need to know how the new multisnap works
out.

Oh, no you misunderstood. Even with your snapshots you'll have to delete
old snapshots someday, because otherwise you'll run out of space. With
LVM however, you have prereserved space for it, so even if your snapshot
volume gets full, it does not affect your filesystem what so ever. And,
as a administrator, you can decide whether to extend the snapshot volume
to let it live longer, or just let it be and it will die eventually.

And, as far as I know, the new multisnap will notify the admin when the
snapshot volume approaches the watermark the same way that for example
thinly provisioned storage would do. But again, with your snapshots it
will give you ENOSPC when the snapshot grow too big, and at the end
of the day, you need to create data to be able to backup it:), so having
snapshots separate from your fs volume makes sense.

Yes, I do understand that ext4 snaphosts are doing well in that aspect,
but as I said, having snapshots separate from your file system gives
you advantage of not running into ENOSPC on your file system until you
really fill it with data.

Granted, I have to take a look at the multisnap code, to see what it can
do and compare it with ext4 snapshots, because really, if it is good
enough and you will be able to do snapshotting backups as you do with
your approach, I do not see the reason why to complicate our life in
ext4.

Thanks!
