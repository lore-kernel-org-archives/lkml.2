So a slightly buggy client can basically DoS the server by getting a
delegation and then crashing or something. Everybody else that tries
to read that directory (not that file) will be dead in the water.
Definitely not good.

I do think it's the only thing we can reasonably do. I'd love to have
some kind of per-dentry lock for unlink/rename, but we don't.
Long-term, we really do need to do something about the directory
locking, though, because it's also a huge problem for readdir()
concurrency. Or at least it used to be (samba in particular). Making
it an rwsem might help readdir a tiny amount, but I suspect people
actually depend on the mutex in readdir right now.

I suspect at some point you just have to say "screw it".
