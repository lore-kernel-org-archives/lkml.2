For volatile, I agree.

However, the original btrfs example was *without* a volatile, and that's
why I raised the memory model point.  This triggered an error in a
concurrent execution, so that's memory model land, at least in C
language standard.

The example was a granularity-of-access violation, I agree.
Nonetheless, C11 has rules for that, they have been written down, it
would good to know whether these rules are sufficient for you.

Any specific examples for that would be interesting.
