Well... The problem when this sort of thing happens is with the replay
cache. If the RPC in question was a mkdir, for instance, then replaying
the RPC call when you wake up can be problematic because chances are
that the server will have forgotten who created the directory, and so
will reply with EEXIST instead of OK.
However this is a generic problem when the client is unable to talk to
the server for a while, and is not particular to suspend.
