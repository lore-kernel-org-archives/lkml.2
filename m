We had some discussion about this week at SF (at the ext4 bof at the
linux colloboration summit). Beyond checksumming the inode itself, it
would be more useful to checksum the extent indexing blocks, as the ext3
corruption actually happen at the indirect block.  

The idea is to reduce the eh_max (the max # of extents stored in this
block) to save some space to store the checksums in the block, 

/*
 * Each block (leaves and indexes), even inode-stored has header.
 */
struct ext4_extent_header {
        __le16  eh_magic;       /* probably will support different
formats */
        __le16  eh_entries;     /* number of valid entries */
        __le16  eh_max;         /* capacity of store in entries */
        __le16  eh_depth;       /* has tree real underlying blocks? */
        __le32  eh_generation;  /* generation of the tree */
};
This would make us a RO feature to checksum the leaves and indexes
blocks too.
