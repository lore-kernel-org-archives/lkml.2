Hello Ric.

No, every leaf shouldn't be necessarily 100% full.
We may require every L-vicinity(*) of every leaf to be full in
some sense. And this local condition sometimes brings the (global)
boundary for utilization of the whole tree.

In the classic Bayer's B-trees we have so-called "S(0)" balancing
condition implicitly satisfied, which requires every leaf to be at
least half full. It provides the low boundary 0.5 for utilization
of the whole tree.

Next example is ReiserFS file system, which uses so-called "S(1)"
balancing condition on the leaf level, which requires every 1-vicinity
of every leaf to be "incompressible" (i.e. two leaves can not be
squeezed to a single one). This local incompressibility brings the
sweet low utilization boundary 0.5-E for the whole tree (E is a small
number, which is back proportional to the tree branching).

(*) any set of L+1 neighboring nodes, which contains the leaf.
