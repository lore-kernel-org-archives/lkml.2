Maybe "retire" for a pithier version of never_use_again:

/**
 * retire_timestamp - prevent a timestamp from being reused as an mtime.
 * @timestamp
 *
 * Advance the clock used to generate mtimes to guarantee that the
 * given timestamp will not be reused on any future mtime update.
 * This allows the given timestamp to be passed back to users such as
 * nfs clients which need the guarantee that mtimes will always change
 * on file updates.
 *
 * Depending on the filesystem's s_time_gran this may not be an ironclad
 * guarantee.

How about just scratching "significantly" and saying "less"?  As long as
we know jiffies is the default time source for mtimes, that should be
safe, shouldn't it?

I didn't even know there were any other than 1 and a billion.  OK!

Interesting list, thanks!
