I have been (occasionally) looking at critical kernel messages.
IMO we really need an easy way to find them.

They can begin with any of these strings (and others can be added
too easily):

BUG|panic|MCE|NMI|error:|Oops|Bad|Fatal|Unrecoverable|Unhandled|Weird

We need a simple (single?) tagging method to identify any/all of these,
/methinks.
