Really?  Huh.  Are these messages debugging only?
Not really.

$ grep "ext4_msg.*EXT4-fs: " fs/ext4/*.c
fs/ext4/mballoc.c:			ext4_msg(sb, KERN_ERR, "EXT4-fs: can't allocate mem "
fs/ext4/mballoc.c:		ext4_msg(sb, KERN_ERR, "EXT4-fs: can't allocate buddy mem");
fs/ext4/mballoc.c:	ext4_msg(ac->ac_sb, KERN_ERR, "EXT4-fs: Can't allocate:"
fs/ext4/mballoc.c:	ext4_msg(ac->ac_sb, KERN_ERR, "EXT4-fs: status %d flags %d",
fs/ext4/mballoc.c:	ext4_msg(ac->ac_sb, KERN_ERR, "EXT4-fs: orig %lu/%lu/%lu@%lu, "

So that they are consistent and extensible and can use
something like pr_<level>_notify, just like pr_<level>_once
and pr_<level>_ratelimited, or some other similar form.
