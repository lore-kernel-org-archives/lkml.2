Subject: [PATCH] USB: fix regression occurring during device removal
In-Reply-To: <1309552148.2722.46.camel@mulgrave>

This patch (as1476) fixes a regression introduced by
fccf4e86200b8f5edd9a65da26f150e32ba79808 (USB: Free bandwidth when
usb_disable_device is called).  usb_disconnect() grabs the
bandwidth_mutex before calling usb_disable_device(), which calls down
indirectly to usb_set_interface(), which tries to acquire the
bandwidth_mutex.

The fix causes usb_set_interface() to return early when it is called
for an interface that has already been unregistered, which is what
happens in usb_disable_device().

This should fix the problem.  Or at least, it does fix a very similar 
problem.
