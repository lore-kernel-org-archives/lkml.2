It is not possible with SATA disks, but native SCSI disks might well
interpret FORMAT UNIT destructively.

In practice, a single write to the first MB of the disk is just as
destructive.  For that you do not even need a SCSI command.

I am not talking about the regular data path, only of SG_IO.

Here are three:

- CAP_SYS_RAWIO partly bypasses DAC; you can issue destructive commands
even if you only opened the disk for reading.  CAP_SYS_RAWIO also gives
access to _really_ destructive commands (WRITE BUFFER and PERSISTENT
RESERVE OUT for example).

- CAP_SYS_RAWIO lets you send SCSI commands to partitions, and they will
gladly read/write the disk going outside the boundaries of the
partition.  Changing this behavior was rejected upstream already.

- CAP_SYS_RAWIO also gives access to I/O ports, mmap at address 0, and
too many other insecure things.

All the above mean that:

- any application using CAP_SYS_RAWIO would have to implement its own
whitelisting, even if just to duplicate what is done in the kernel;

- exploiting a CAP_SYS_RAWIO process leads to root too easily, and it is
not possible to give the capability to anything that will run in a
hostile environment (in my case QEMU).
