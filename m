You want:

struct seccomp_data {
	int nr;
	__u32 __reserved[3];
	__u64 arg[6];
	__u64 instruction_pointer;
};

And I agree it looks a lot nicer.

You can pretend a 64-bit arg will be one field, but it won't be. It will
be always two fields no matter what. Making them adjacent is only good
because seccomp_data won't have to change if 64-bit support is ever added
to BPF.

It looks nicer, but it only makes it harder to know the right offset for
the fields for the 32-bit only BPF programs. You can try to hide reality,
but that won't change it.

Except that if you don't hide the platform differences your compiler
or whatever needs to generate different instructions depending on the
endianess, while it could always generate the same instructions instead.

My impression is that you want to push all extra complexity into the
compiler or whatever instead of making the ABI cross-platform, because
it looks nicer. I don't care that much, but I think you're just pushing
the ugliness around instead of getting rid of it.

Greetings,

Indan
