you don't want to just pass the value down as that will cause problems 
with layering (especially if the lower layer supports more values than a 
higher layer)

I would suggest that each layer take the value it's give, do an integer 
division by the number of values that layer supports, using the modulo 
value for that layer and pass the rest of the result down to the next 
layer.

this works for just trying values until you get the error that tells you 
there are no more options.


things can get very 'intersesting' if the different options below you have 
different number of options (say a raid1 across a raid5 and a single disk) 
but I can't think of any good way to figure this out and assemble a 
sane order without doing an exaustive search down to find the number of 
options for each layer (and since this can be different for different 
blocks, you would have to do this each time you invoked this option)
