Yeah, but do you need xstat information at all for something like
that? Most people try very hard to make do with the information
returned by readdir itself (d_type and inode number), because if you
end up looking up each name you've already pretty much lost in a
performance model.

(And I do agree that a "readdirplus()" is probably something that a
lot of server people would find useful, but obviously that's another
cross-filesystem nightmare. Only a few filesystems can cheaply give
you anything but d_type/d_ino, and not all do even that),
