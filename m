No no, the case I reported was triggered by an unclean shutdown: my son 
hitting the power button after a system crash, or more likely when the 
graphics subsystem became unresponsive.

by now it attests a bill of clean health. at first it reported issues 
the precise nature of which escaping my memory, fixed them, and after 
the next reboot reported some more issues which again were fixed. Had I 
known this will look similar to a prominent issue I would have paid more 
attention.

no, I just mentioned the suspend/resume cycles to explain what is going 
on in the syslog, which I didn't attach in the end. During the period of 
the problem building up there was no suspend/resume event.

I hear what you are saying. I just want to add that the hardware has 
survived the past two or three years despite suspend/resume and the odd 
abusive treatment (like unclean shutdown by non-techie users). I tend to 
keep the kernel, patches, modules and user land up to date.

Shall do.
