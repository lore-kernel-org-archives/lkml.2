Ok I do understand this, but as other people in the thread already told
you, this is not a proper fix. If you have a performance problem when the
conversion from uninitialized to initialized happens, than the obvious
answer is figure out why and fix it, rather than create crazy workaround
without even properly testing why this is happening.
