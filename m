Oops, you're right. I think that the best solution would be to revert
the commit

c03f8aa9abdd517477c2021ea1251939b4da49e6
ext4: use FIEMAP_EXTENT_LAST flag for last extent in fiemap

and then fix the original problem with your delayed extent tree
solution, where we can easily check not only for next allocated extent,
but also for next delayed extent to see if the current one is last or
not.

Currently, the problem is that at the point we are filling the fiemap
extent with fiemap_fill_next_extent() we do not have enough information
to say whether the extent is really the last or is not. And currently
there is not easy way to check for next delayed extent (which will be
fixed with your delayed extent tree).

I do not know how "ready" are your patches..Is it possible to wait for
them to be ready and fix it in your patch set ? That means, revert the
mentioned commit and reimplement fiemap with delayed extent tree.

Thanks!
