The filesystems already enforce the ordering, except reiserfs which
opts out if the barrier options is set.

What other trees do you mean?  The conversions of the 8 filesystems
that actually support barriers need to go through this tree anyway
if we want to be able to test it.  Also the changes in the filesystem
are absolutely minimal - it's basically just
s/WRITE_BARRIER/WRITE_FUA_FLUSH/ after my initial patch kill BH_Orderd,
and removing about 10 lines of code in reiserfs.

You're right.

The current bio_empty_barrier is only used in dm, and indeed only makes
sense for make_request-based drivers.  But I think it's a rather useful
helper for them.  Either way, it's not a big issue and either way is
fine with me.

Which priority?

Hmm, okay.  I see how the special flush_bio makes the waiting easier,
let's see if Mike or other in the DM team have a better idea.
