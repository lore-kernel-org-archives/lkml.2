/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug exists to tell the kernel where to find the hotplug
binary.  Once upon a time /sys/hotplug was the default value, and that was
there to overwrite it.  (They changed the default to blank (disabled) not due
to policy reasons, but due to adding the netlink hotplug notification
mechanism and making that the default.)

I bring that up to point out that the general consensus about policy in the
kernel seems to be "when you really really can't avoid having any, make a
sane default the user can override".

(Of course adding another entry to the crawling horror of /proc may not
be an improvement.  But individual overrides at the mount -o level seem
like a non-optimal granularity for this...)

You mean more than one inside a given process's view of the filesystem, taking
into account chroot like /proc/mounts does?

Before this patch series, there was one instance systemwide.  The patch changed
that to look a fixed location in the filesystem relative to the
current chroot.  Either
way, there was one instance available to a given process doing an nfs mount.

What's the use case for having more than one visible to a given process?
(NUMA scalability?  Some sort of multipath/VPN routing context?)
