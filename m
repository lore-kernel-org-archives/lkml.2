I don't insist on getting this in sooner than in the next merge window,
although I would have liked that.  Relevant userspace vulnerabilities
are being found quite often - I'll include some examples below.

This makes sense.

Yes, and this is a pretty common case.

RLIMIT_NPROC could be set by the parent process or by pam_limits.  The
machine I am typing this on has:

*       hard    nproc   200

(as well as other limits) in /etc/security/limits.conf, so if this
machine's kernel let setuid() fail on RLIMIT_NPROC, I would be taking
extra risk of a security compromise by reducing the risk of system
crashes from inadvertent excessive resource consumption by runaway
processes - a tradeoff I'd rather avoid.

Right.  (In practice, all kinds of programs tend to forget to check
setuid() return value, though.)

Actually, for the problem to apply to setuid-root programs, they need to
switch their real uid first (more fully become root), then try to switch
to a user - but this is common.

Here are some examples for 2011-2010:

"... missing setuid() retval check in opielogin which leads to easy root
compromise":

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/22/6

"The /usr/lib/libgnomesu/gnomesu-pam-backend suid binary which belongs
to the libgnomesu package is not checking setuid() return values.

As a result, two cooperating users, or users with access to guest,
cgi or web accounts can run arbitrary commands as root very easily."

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/05/30/2

pam_xauth (exploitable if pam_limits is also used):

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/08/16/2

A collection of examples from 2006:

Right, but to me possibly resetting rlimits is not an "alternative" to
moving the RLIMIT_NPROC check.  setuid-root exec is not the only case
where having setuid() fail on RLIMIT_NPROC is undesirable.  We also
don't want such failures with pam_limits, nor on daemon startup:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/07/14/2

As to resetting rlimits on SUID/SGID exec, I think this would make
sense for RLIMIT_FSIZE, which would mitigate the mount mtab issue
(thank you for bringing it up!)  But it's to be discussed separately.
