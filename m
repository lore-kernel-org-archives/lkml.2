-The cgroup system is about to destroy the passed cgroup; the subsystem
-should do any necessary cleanup and free its subsystem state
-object. By the time this method is called, the cgroup has already been
-unlinked from the file system and from the child list of its parent;

-int pre_destroy(struct cgroup *cgrp);

-Called before checking the reference count on each subsystem. This may
-be useful for subsystems which have some extra references even if
-there are not tasks in the cgroup. If pre_destroy() returns error code,
-rmdir() will fail with it. From this behavior, pre_destroy() can be

+Called after @cgrp successfully completed all allocations and made

+This is the counterpart of css_online() and called iff css_online()

+all references it's holding on @cgrp. When all references are dropped,
+cgroup removal will proceed to the next step - css_free(). After this
+callback, @cgrp should be considered dead to the subsystem.
