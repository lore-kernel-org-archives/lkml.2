Yes, I am sure. :)

You don't call accept() on an SCTP SEQPACKET socket.  You can just read from it.
SCTP uses SOCK_SEQPACKET to implement 1-to-many semantics, where you can have
multiple associations all serviced by the same socket.  In that case, the socket
is placed into the listening state and then the application may simply read
from it.

Thus your code that just returns the size of the first skb should take that into
consideration.

So the condition really is:
  if (sctp_style(sk, TCP) && sctp_state(sk, LISTENING))
	goto out;

This way, you'll ignore listening SOCK_STREAM sockets which will not have any
data anyway, but you'll check out listening SOCK_SEQPACKET sockets that may have
data waiting on them.
