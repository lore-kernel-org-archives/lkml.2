Hi Tejun,

Thank you for your comments.

Yes. I agree that we need structured error reporting.
This facility will be discussed by Kay Sievers at Kernel Summit.

However I think that even if it is applied in kernel, "alias" is still
necessary because users want to use and see friendly name which can be
simple, short and preference, instead of persistent device names (e.g.
/dev/disk/by-uuid/35d4def7-9098-448c-8cc3-b0cb74c8670b).

Our concern is the failure analysis. For example, when the disk failure
happened, we need to identify the disk from kernel log.

Kernel messages are output to serial console when kernel crashes.
It's so hard to convert a device name to the alias. Thus the script
can't always convert the name.

Also, the alias is useful for users because they can use and see the
same name everywhere(e.g. commands, kernel log).
