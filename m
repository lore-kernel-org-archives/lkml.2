It looks like the inode_bitmap_bh is being modified outside a transaction:

                ret2 = ext4_test_and_set_bit(ino, inode_bitmap_bh->b_data);

It needs a get_write_access / handle_dirty_metadata pair around it.

A hacky patch like this seems to work but it was done 5mins before I have
to be out the door to dinner so it probably needs cleanup or at least
scrutiny.

[PATCH] ext4: fix unjournaled inode bitmap modification

commit 119c0d4460b001e44b41dcf73dc6ee794b98bd31 modified this function
such that the inode bitmap was being modified outside a transaction,
which could lead to corruption, and was discovered when journal_checksum
found a bad checksum in the journal.
