I hate the for loops, even though we're about indeed to read all the
scatterlists anyway... all they do is lengthen critical sections.  Also,
being the first user of chained scatterlist doesn't exactly give me warm
fuzzies.

I think it's simpler if we provide an API to add individual buffers to
the virtqueue, so that you can do multiple virtqueue_add_buf_more
(whatever) before kicking the virtqueue.  The idea is that I can still
use indirect buffers for the scatterlists that come from the block layer
or from an skb, but I will use direct buffers for the request/response
descriptors.  The direct buffers are always a small number (usually 2),
so you can balance the effect by making the virtqueue bigger.  And for
small reads and writes, you save a kmalloc on a very hot path.

(BTW, scatterlists will have separate entries for each page; we do not
need this in virtio buffers.  Collapsing physically-adjacent entries
will speed up QEMU and will also help avoiding indirect buffers).
