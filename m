Let me make sure I understand since I don't have a great grasp of the
freezer internals...

This will set the PF_FREEZER_SKIP flag on the task, which prevents
try_to_freeze_tasks from incrementing the "todo" var for this process
and should let the suspend proceed.

So this really makes try_to_freeze_tasks set PF_FREEZING on the task,
but not get upset that it doesn't actually call try_to_freeze().

Is that sufficient for a process that's just sleeping here?

If so, guess I'll need to respin the NFS/RPC patches for this to do
something similar around the sleeps there since they don't use
wait_event_*.

wait_event_state() sounds like a wonderful idea regardless of what we
do here.
