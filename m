Hi Jeff,

So this patchset relies on idling on WRITE_SYNC queues. Though in general
we don't have examples that why one should idle on processes doing WRITE_SYNC
IO because previous IO does not tell anything about the upcoming IO. I am
bringing up this point again to make sure that fundamentally we agree that
continue to idle on WRITE_SYNC is the right thing to do otherwise this patch
will fall apart.

I have yet to go through the patch in detail but allowing other queue to
dispatch requests in the same queue sounds like queue merging. So can
we use that semantics to say elv_merge_context() or elv_merge_queue()
instead of elv_yield(). In the code we can just merge the two queues when
the next request comes in and separate them out at the slice expiry I 
guess.

Thanks
Vivek
