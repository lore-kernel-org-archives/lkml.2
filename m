Well, since you've written a storage driver, I really hope that question
is rhetorical ...

The reason for using GFP_ATOMIC from user context in storage drivers is
to avoid writeout deadlock:  you don't want to trigger a swap write
while you potentially occupy the writeout path.  In all older drivers
this had to be GFP_ATOMIC because GFP_NOIO wasn't around.

This also illustrates the problem with design patterns:  The idea that
if you have user context, you must be able to kmalloc GFP_KERNEL seems
logical to the people who wrote the pattern, but actually it's
potentially incorrect for storage.

Now in the particular case of sg, I don't believe we'll ever want to
swap over sg (famous last words, of course), so in this instance we
probably could get away with using GFP_KERNEL ... but since it's
following the storage pattern, GFP_ATOMIC (or GFP_NOIO) is correct.

Does osd need auditing for this problem (or would no-one ever do swap
over osd)?

This pattern occurs many times in storage ... documenting it at every
callsite would be a huge waste.
