I am assuming that our aim is to be fully compatible with zfs.

I tried running the test on it and it failed. One reason was
that the default allocation size on zfs is 128K. The test assumes
4K. The other was our understanding of the various corner cases.
And lastly, the values for SEEK_DATA and SEEK_HOLE are 3 and 4
respectively. Not vice-versa.

So I enhanced the test a bit and have it running on zfs. If someone
else can, please do verify my results.

BTW, This test also does not touch fallocate.
