This should be all advertised in /sys/block/sda - definitely worth encouraging 
this for devices. I think that the device mapper "thin" target also supports 
discard so you could get this behaviour with all devices if needed.

We also have a WRITE_SAME (with default pattern of zero data) that has long been 
used in SCSI to initialize data.

We are still papering over an issue that seems to not be a challenge for XFS.

I would prefer to let the very few crazy application programmers who need this 
do insane things instead of opening and exposing data to these applications.

Or have them use a different file system that does not have this same penalty 
(or to the same degree).

Thanks!
