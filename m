That would only prove its not dm-crypt; it would not absolve a non-DM
2.6.37-rc change at all.

Leveraging the fact that 2.6.36 + parallel dm-crypt is reportedly very
solid: maybe these would be more interesting (each would keep the latest
parallel dm-crypt patch overlayed for all tests):

1) Test 2.6.37-rc prior to all flush+fua changes (only changes DM saw
   for 2.6.37-rc so far).

2) Back out all ext4 changes that were merged for 2.6.37-rc
   - though Heinz is using XFS exclussively and still reported
     corruption

3) A full git bisect of good=v2.6.36 bad=v2.6.37-rc4 would be the most
   interesting.  Albeit much more tedious.
