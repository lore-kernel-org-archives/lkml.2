Oddly, I ran the entire suite of tests against a larger set of machines, and
with Tejun's RFC patchset I didn't see nearly as much of an improvement.  I
have been trying to put together a new tree based on "replace barrier with
sequenced flush" and Christoph's "explicitly flush/FUA" patch sets, though I've
gotten lost in the weeds. :(

I also experienced some sort of crash with Tejun's relaxed barrier patch on one
of my systems.  I was hitting the BUG_ON in drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c, line 1115.

Rather than hold on to (aging) test results any further, I'll be posting a new
fsync coordination patch shortly that includes Andreas' suggestion to use the
average barrier time instead of a static 500us, and a spreadsheet that shows
what happens with various patches, and on a wider range of hardware.
