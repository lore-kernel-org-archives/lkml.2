Just idea. (perhaps it's too dumb).

If a user want to know throughput, usually they only need KB/s granularity.
If a user want to know password hints, they need to know strict bytes granularity.
So, adding some random bytes to this statistics may help to obscure key data,
or just "stat = ROUND_UP(stat, 1024)".

But, I hope to wait another experts response. they may know better approach. :)

Dunno. I'm not security expert.

Can you please explain more? I'm feeling "reset at credential change" is
reasonable idea. How broken is there?

Umm. reasonable. task->signal->cred_guard_mutex can be used for preventing
exec() race, I think. (see check_mem_permission() and et al).
