Exactly and IIRC ext4 have directory entries stored in hash order which
does not really help the sequential access.

I have the same question, note that if the files on ext4 has been worked
with it may very well be that directory hash trees are not in very good
shape. You can attempt to optimize that by e2fsck (just run fsck.ext4 -f
<device>) but that may take quite some time and memory, but it is worth
trying.
