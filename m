As James said, *at the time*, USB overrode the SBC_2 claims from USB
devices and forced them to be SCSI_2.  So no amount of testing we did
would have uncovered this.

I wrote this code ... James' memory is off.  What happened is that T10
in their infinite wisdom decided to put things like "supports TRIM" and
"is actually a 4k block size but fakes 512 byte blocks" in the Read
Capacity 16 results.  So if we want to support those kinds of things
(and I think we do), then we need to send Read Capacity 16 to devices.

It's not about "enterprise features" at all, but about supporting the
next generation of standard consumer drives.  I'm tempted to say the
USB Storage driver needs to go back to the way things were, because I
don't see any other way to fix this.

I have no idea what Windows is doing to support these features.  That
might be a fruitful course of investigation.
