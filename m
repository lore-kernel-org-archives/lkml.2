Well, T10 always gives the most conservative approach.  All other array
(and certainly all disk) vendors seem to confirm valid data up to the
error ... certainly for the DIF case, Martin secured this agreement.

Such a patch is harder than you think.  We certainly don't want to
bother disks with this ... the read with medium error probably took
several seconds, so we never want to hit that sector again.

I think the correct approach is:

     1. If we got data up to (and possibly including) the error sector,
        we're done and we assume good data and terminate the command.
     2. If we got an error sector and less good data than we should,
        then we might need to repeat.  But currently failing the entire
        transaction at that point with what we have is good
     3. For the outlier repeat path, I think reconstructing the SCSI
        command to request data up to the error sector is best.  We
        still have to recognise this on return so as not to emit another
        read for the bad sector.

The proposed patch already does 1 & 2 ... I think we can do 3 later
depending on just how common the outlier arrays are.
