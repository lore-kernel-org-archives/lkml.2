That's not what I meant at all.  I meant there may be things out there that
will just use st_btime and st_gen as soon as they appear without anything
having to be done to them because these fields already exist in the BSD stat
struct.

Samba is such an example as this.  It will use st_btime immediately if it
exists as the SMB protocol wants to pass the creation time around.

Not having ls cause a mass automount just because you did an ls of a directory
full of automount points would be very nice.

Perhaps.  As previously mentioned, BSD (and other unices) already make some of
these fields available (notably st_btime and st_gen).  We could also make a
BSD-compatible st_flags available.

I initially did them by getxattr(), but that didn't go down too well.

I suspect they would, though maybe they can say otherwise.  What about SMB
directory enumeration?  I believe that is effectively getdents-with-stat.
Having to do open+stat for each file for that would be painful.
