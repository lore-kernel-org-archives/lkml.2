I guess it's a good thing when one can commit such a public blunder and
still manage to be somewhat helpful?  If so I don't feel 'quite' so
sheepish now.  :)

NOTE to $self:  when you subscribe to Linux dev lists, the odds are
_much_ greater that people who actually write the software you use _are_
the people posting messages.  Perform SENDER_IDENTITY_CHECK and
SANITY_CHECK routines in the future before referring an author to his
own documentation. ;)
