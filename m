We could, but it wouldn't fix the problem.  The system issue is that
->done isn't symmetrical to ->prep_rq_fn() ... ->done() sits in the
middle of the SCSI completion path and we could decide to requeue the
command after calling it (that's why we can't free the discard page
either in ->done() or in the midlayer where ->done() is called).

The system solution is a symmetrical pair for ->prep_rq_fn() which is
only called either after all error handling is complete, or we decide to
completely strip the command down for a retry that goes through prep
again.

So I buy this more.  There is a slight assymmetry in that we have the
bio in prep, but not in unprep.  Since requests can complete partially
(freeing the bios on the way), there's no real way to avoid this.  I
think the use of ->buffer is a bit unsavoury but it looks acceptable.
