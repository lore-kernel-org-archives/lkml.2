That sounds like a proper bug, maybe it can be fixed at least?

Watching an entire filesystem entails reading all the directories, but
you don't have to fetch the inodes of files.  But still, it's very
slow (takes about 15 minutes on my /home from cold cache, just to read
the million or so directories).

There was some work on propagating events upwards so that efficient
recursive watches could be established, in the context of fanotify but
it would make sense to be available to all fsnotify users.  I wonder
how that went.

Yes... That's ok if it's one we are tracking inode->multiple-paths in
userspace anyway (for hard links).  But it's quite demanding if we
hoped to avoid fetching and storing that in userspace for
st_nlink == 1 files.

In that case it is still better to get a notification "something
unknown on this FS has changed", rather than no notification.
Userspace would react by flushing all of its cached knowledge of
things under directory watches that don't have direct watches.  But at
least that's reliable and correct behaviour, and if it happens often,
userspace heuristics can react by watching priority inodes more directly.

If that's the common case, then these nameless, pathless events could
just trigger a simple event with catch-all IN_NO_PATH flag set,
referring to the filesytem but no more detail than that.  inotify
would accept that flag when adding a watch, ignore the inode given but
remember the filesystem, and send all events with no path to the
watch(es) created with that flag on that filesystem.  It's a flag
because the event type is still useful.

All the best,
