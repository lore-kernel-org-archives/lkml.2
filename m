It must be a highly unexpected and difficult question for file system
developers: "how efficiently does your file system manage disk space"?

In the meanwhile I confirm that Btrfs design is completely broken:
records stored in the B-tree differ greatly from each other (it is
unacceptable!), and the balancing algorithms have been modified in
insane manner. All these factors has led to loss of *all* boundaries
holding internal fragmentation and to exhaustive waste of disk space
(and memory!) in spite of the property "scaling in their ability to
address large storage".

This is not a large storage, this is a "scalable sieve": you can not
rely on finding there some given amount of water even after infinite
increasing the size of the sieve (read escalating the pool of Btrfs
devices).

It seems that nobody have reviewed Btrfs before its inclusion to the
mainline. I have only found a pair of recommendations with a common
idea that Btrfs maintainer is "not a crazy man". Plus a number of
papers which admire with the "Btrfs phenomena". Sigh.

Well, let's decide what can we do in current situation..
The first obvious point here is that we *can not* put such file system
to production. Just because it doesn't provide any guarantees for our
users regarding disk space utilization.

I'll explain on a simple example, why is it important. Think of a file
system as a bank, which deducts an interest q. I.e. amount of money N
that you put on your account can be reduced to (N - qN). That said,
in order to buy a suit which costs M you should put to your account
not less than M/(1-q). Now imagine that the bank deducts 100% (q=1).
Will you bring your money to such bank? No. Not just because you are
greedy, but also because you won't be able to schedule your purchases.
So why should we push our users to keep money in such bank?

I should remind for developers that we work for *users*. They want a
*good* environment to run programs. Our subsystems should provide
*efficient* management of user's resources (such as memory and disk
space). A subsystem which is going to send all user's resources to the
toilet is *bad*!!!

If you decide to base your file system on some algorithms then please
use the original ones from proper academic papers. DO NOT modify the
algorithms in solitude: this is very fragile thing! All such
modifications must be reviewed by specialists in the theory of
algorithms. Such review can be done in various scientific magazines of
proper level.

Personally I don't see any way to improve the situation with Btrfs
except full redesigning the last one. If you want to base your file
system on the paper of Ohad Rodeh, then please, use *exactly* the
Bayer's B-trees that he refers to. That said, make sure that all
records you put to the tree has equal length and all non-root nodes of
your tree are at least half filled.

As to current Btrfs code: *NOT ACK*!!! I don't think we need such
"file systems".

Thanks!
