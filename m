Hmm, what does that mean exactly? Does a linux nfs4-server support numeric 
uids/gids? If yes, by default or do I need do set an option?

The only thing I can say is that in the moment client and server are using 
rpc.idmapd and it works perfectly well.

I always thought that the idmapper with its translation were exactly for that 
case. If I have a homogenous uid/gid name space why would I want to use names 
and translate anyway?
