Don't get me wrong, neither am I. I'm just thinking out loud and
pondering. As a general mechanism, yield to a specific cfqq is going to
be tricky and doing a generic yield to signal that _someone_ else must
make progress before we can is better than nothing.

Continuing that train of thought, I don't think we'll ever need full
'yield to X' functionality where 'X' is a really specific target. But
for this fsync case, we know at least what we are yielding to and it
seems like a shame to throw away that information. So you could include
a hint of what to yield to, which cfq could factor in.

Dunno, I need to think a bit about the cleanliness of such an approach.
We can definitely use your patch as a starting point.
