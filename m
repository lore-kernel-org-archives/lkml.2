Thank you, Joe, for those good examples. I may not know for what SYSFS
was _originally_ designed, but the current reality is that SYSFS is
_widely_ used to both represent the kernel internal configuration as
well as to change it. And SCST is just following that.

After all, if SYSFS supposed to only represent the kernel internal
configuration, why wasn't it from the beginning made read-only?
