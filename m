Why, I'm not allowed to get frustrated at repeated attempts to get the
original poster to change their code to something that is acceptable and
just give up and walk away?

Why not?

It is also the job of the kernel community to say "No, what you are

Yes, that is what I have been saying for a while now.

	This code is using kobjects incorrectly.
	This code should not be using kobjects.

this is my last response to this thread now, and I'm sure you can
understand why.
