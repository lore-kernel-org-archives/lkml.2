What happened to the initial idea of just using the BIO_RW_META flag
for log writes?  In the end log writes are the most important writes you
have in a journaled filesystem, and they should not be effect to any
kind of queue idling logic or other interruption.  Log I/O is usually
very little (unless you use old XFS code with a worst-case directory
manipulation workload), and very latency sensitive.
