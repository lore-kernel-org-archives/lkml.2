Right, so if I understand correctly, you're proposing a time source
that's global to the filesystem and that guarantees it will always
return a unique value by incrementing the nanoseconds field if jiffies
haven't changed since the last time it was called.

(Does it really need to be global across all filesystems?  Or is it
unreasonable to expect your unbelievably-fast make's to behave well when
sources and targets live on different filesystems?)
