I've been playing around with resurrecting the basic sysfs
capabilities that had been previously incorporated into btrfs.

As it stands right now, it was relatively easy to re-implement sysfs
as it was originally.  However, that implementation of sysfs wasn't
populated with much information (only total_blocks, blocks_used, and
blocksize).

I also had to reverse a small portion of code that was in the last clean-up.

If a CONFIG_BTRFS_DEBUG type configuration flag is ever introduced, it
would be interesting to resurrect btrfs' sysfs capabilities.
