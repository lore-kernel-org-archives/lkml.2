You're asking difficult questions. ;-)

The intention was to prevent PF_FREEZER_SKIP from having any effect on
kernel threads, IIRC.  Anyway, there are only two legitimate users of it
(vfork and apm_ioctl) and in both cases the task in question is user space.

PF_FREEZER_SKIP was introduced specifically with vfork in mind and I'm not
sure if it's a good idea to re-use it for something else (at least not for
something entirely obvious).
