It seems like you're having to do a lot of work on each individual rpc
server (callback server, lockd, etc.) to make per-net startup/shutdown
work.  And then we still don't have it quite right (see the shutdown
races).)

In general whenever we have the opportunity to have entirely separate
data structures, I'd expect that to simplify things: it should eliminate
some locking and reference-counting issues.

There really should be some way to create a kernel thread in a specific
namespace, shouldn't there?

Until we have that, could the threads be taught to fix their namespace
on startup?
