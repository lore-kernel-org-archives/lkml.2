Thanks Eric, yes there is padding but we don't have anything to fill the
hole with :(

If it becomes important to save space, i_state_flags seem to be unused
in ext4 so we could possibly drop that.

With my patch applied, under slub I'm getting one more object per slab
in the ext4_inode_cache

[2.6.35] 17 objects of 960 bytes -- 4 pages per slab
[+patch] 18 objects of 896 bytes -- 4 pages per slab

So I guess that is where most of the write test performance improvement
came from.

regards
Richard
