I admit I don't fully realize all possible containers' uses, but doesn't
procfs is mounted inside of containers for only restricted full-featured
Linux distros usermods with the whole init and init scripts set?  I
didn't see any consistent usages of procfs for other things, do they
exist?

Creating separate namespaces is very useful for additional daemon
restrictions like vsftpd does it, but procfs inside of such namespace is
obviously denied by design ;)


And as procfs is a one instance per pid namespace, it has the same
permissions in all mount points, so I see no problem with chroot
(however, I find chroot not very useful with procfs inside).

Thanks,
