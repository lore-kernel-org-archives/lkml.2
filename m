Where is the synchronization on the new work queue when the module is getting
removed? The target get/put code does nothing to the module refcount, and
cleanup_netconsole just deletes targets, it doesn't block or fail on netconsole
refcounts, so you could run this work after the module has been removed and oops
the system.
