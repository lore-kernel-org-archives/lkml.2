They are not broken.  The problem is that it's possible to configure a
kernel that doesn't build.  Note the config resulting from the
mx1_defconfig target fully conform to the restrictions expressed in the
Kconfig files even if arch/arm/configs/mx1_defconfig doesn't.  So if
NFS_V4 was selecting CRYPTO (or CRYPTO would default to y in the
presence of NFS_V4) mx1_defconfig would enable it implicitly.

If NFSD_V4 selects RPCSEC_GSS_KRB5 which in turn selects SUNRPC_GSS the
latter should be enabled in all builds that have NFSD_V4=y (assuming all
dependencies are fulfilled), no?

The problem that needed fixing before your commit was that
RPCSEC_GSS_KRB5 depended on EXPERIMENTAL while NFS_V4 did not (and so
the select RPCSEC_GSS_KRB5 done by NFS_V4 didn't work if EXPERIMENTAL
was unset.)  So the minimal fix would have been to remove the "&&
EXPERIMENTAL" from RPCSEC_GSS_KRB5.

Your commit additionally did the following:

 - change the default of RPCSEC_GSS_KRB5 to y if !(NFS_V4 || NFSD_V4)
 - let RPCSEC_GSS_KRB5 depend on CRYPTO (was *select* CRYPTO before)
 - express the dependency NFSD_V4 -> RPCSEC_GSS_KRB5 at the latter
   symbol (was expressed at NFSD_V4 before)

So because of the second change listed above now my situation is similar
to Randy's earlier, but my problem is I don't have CRYPTO while Randy's
was that he didn't have EXPERIMENTAL.  (That's what I guess, I didn't
read the corresponding thread.)

Subsuming the situation your commit fixed a problem but introduced a
very similar one.

That would be OK for me, too.  Do you do it?  I guess this has to wait
for the next merge window, so I suggest to still take my patch.

I understand your construct, but I think it's non sensible to do it this
way.  You're hiding a dependency of NFS_V4 this way (to the developper,
not the user configuring the kernel).

Uwe
