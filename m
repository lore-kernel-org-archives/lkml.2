Actually, there's a related one: suppose we have two mounts from the same
server, with the same flags, etc., ending up sharing a dentry on client.
What will we get from GETATTR asking for fs_locations, in fs_root field?

Can an nfs4 server e.g. have /x/y being a symlink that resolves to /a/b and
allow mounting of both /x/y/c and /a/b/c?  Which path would it return to
client that has mounted both, walked to some referral point and called
nfs_do_refmount(), triggering nfs4_proc_fs_locations()?

Trond, Neil?
