If this case, and this case only, the change to nfs4_disable_idmapper will result in you now seeing the correct owner/group for these files (just as if you were using NFSv3).

Actually, let me amend that last statement.

The only broken server we found was the Linux server, which was
returning NFS4ERR_BADNAME in a situation where the protocol specified
that it should be returning NFS4ERR_BADOWNER. This is why we have the
little comment "The following works around a Linux server bug!" in the
client code.
Commit f6af99ec1b261e21219d5eba99e3af48fc6c32d4 (nfsd4: name->id mapping
should fail with BADOWNER not BADNAME) fixed that server bug exactly one
year ago, and the fix was subsequently pushed to stable@kernel.org...

IOW: unless you find something earth-shattering when you enable the
option in your existing clients (the option has existed since 2.6.39),
I'd prefer to change the default as soon as possible in order to fix the
existing brokenness for those people running NFSv4 without the benefit
of an ldap/nis/yp server to ensure a homogeneous uid/gid name space...
