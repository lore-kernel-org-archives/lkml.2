Hello, Paolo.

Sorry about the delay.  -EWASTRAVELING and it seems Jens was too.

If your use case at hand is mostly virtualization, I personally would
prefer the latter solution instead of extending in-kernel SG_IO
filter.  It could be that I'm just not aware but I don't think there
have been too many complaints regarding other use cases.  This type of
deep inspection and filtering has fairly strong tendency to be
unpopular.  Userland configurable one is even scarier and I don't
think too many would know and make use of it in the end.

Jens, what are your thoughts?

Thanks.
