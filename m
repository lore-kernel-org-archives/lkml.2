I wrote the above in 2.0.x days (circa 1998) and it was based on FUD
rather than on any real evidence of any breakage.  Apache and PostgreSQL
were a couple of known users of shared memory segments, and these did
not break.  I was not aware of any programs that presumably did break.
Of course, those probably do exist, but I don't recall anyone ever
reporting any to me (as maintainer of -ow patches), although the warning
quoted above might have played a role in such non-reporting.
