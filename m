Some thoughts:

1) Objects created early in the boot process usually has predictable
addresses.  If an attacker knows the address of one such object, he may
learn the cookie.

2) Lower bits of this cookie don't make sense as object addresses are
aligned.

3) I'm afraid addresses of objects of different types which were
kmalloc'ed still depend on each other.  I.e:

    OBJ1 is type A
    OBJ2 is type B

    OBJ2 = OBJ1 + 0x20

    (OBJ1^COOKIE1) ^ (OBJ2^COOKIE2) =
    = (COOKIE1^COOKIE2) ^ (OBJ1^(OBJ1+0x20)) = (COOKIE1^COOKIE2)^(0x20+Carry_bits)

3) I'm afraid the weakest property of XOR can be used by an attacker:

(OBJ1^COOKIE) ^ (OBJ2^COOKIE) = OBJ1^OBJ2


As was said previously, one could create multiple objects which have
linearly increasing addresses and learn cookie lower bits.


Doing something like hash(cookie1 ++ obj ++ cookie) would leak only the
equation of two objects, but it can be still dangerous - learn hashes of
(a) objects created at boot time (their addresses are known) and (b)
some objects, which allocation scheme is known (i.e. we know
kmem_cache_alloc() gives us specific addresses with high probability),
and then compare the hashes against other objects after (a) and (b)
objects are kfree'd.


What is the highest timeframe which must maintain the property of unique
ids?  Is it the whole system lifetime or probably [dump start; dump
end] and we can change the cookie many times?  Can we probably shorten
the time even?  Can we ensure that during this timeframe no new kernel
objects will be created (unrealistic, but would be great)?

Also, I didn't understand from the quoted text who will use it - only
the dumper or this interface is exposed to all userspace processes and
anybody may learn hash(&kern_obj) for any kern_obj he may reference?

Thanks,
