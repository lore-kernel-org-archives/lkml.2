  Yeah, you are right. As I wrote in the introductory mail, there's problem
with metadata operations (e.g. directory modifications) anyway so we'll
have to audit all places where transactions are started. First I'll do this
for ext4 as a POC and then I'll try to do that for XFS if Eric doesn't beat
me to it (he promised to have a look at XFS part ;).
