As I read 3.3-rc1 which I have handy I do not see problems.

An exec_id check adds no value, to files like /proc/pid/environ.
mm_for_maps nicely does the necessary permission checks and avoids the
race.

Then the permission checks at access time are broken, and exec_id
nonsense won't make them better.

We see problems because we lots of people play in the code and are not
careful.  It looks to me like you are trying to make the problem worse
by making the code more complicated and even harder to understand.

You are thrashing the code and making it more complicated for no
apparent reason.

Please show me how you can drop privileges to access yourself.

The current == task check is there because of extreme silliness in
the security modules and the fact that glibc breaks in entertaining
was if it can not access /proc/self/masp.  If you I read you right
you want to reintroduce that breaking for suid exectuables.  Frankly
that sounds like you a security bug in the making.

The /proc/<pid>/mem permission checks were implemented in a very stupid
way.  In that stupid way they used task->exec_id.  I don't see any
evidence that anyone touching any of the other proc files made that same
foolish set of choices.  So I see no evidence that the problem exists
outside of anywhere except /proc/<pid>/mem.

So very simply it looks to me like your entire patchset is very busily
trying to fix problems that don't exist.
