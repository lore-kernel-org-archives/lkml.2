Just to show some numbers I made a simple test on a fresh btrfs fs. I
copied my hosts /usr (4 gig) folder to that fs and checked metadata
usage with "btrfs fi df /mnt", which was around 300m. Then I created
10 snapshots and checked metadata usage again, which didn't change
much. Then I run "grep foobar /mnt -R" to update all files atime.
After this was finished, metadata usage was 2.59 gig. So I lost 2.2
gig just because I searched for something. If someone already has
nearly no space left, he probably won't be able to move some data to
another disk, as he may get ENOSPC while copying the data.

Here is the output of the final "btrfs fi df":

# btrfs fi df /mnt
Data: total=6.01GB, used=4.19GB
System, DUP: total=8.00MB, used=4.00KB
System: total=4.00MB, used=0.00
Metadata, DUP: total=3.25GB, used=2.59GB
Metadata: total=8.00MB, used=0.00

I don't know much about other filesystems that support snapshots, but
I have the feeling that most of them would have the same problem. Also
all other filesystems in combination with LVM snapshots may cause
problems (I'm not very familiar with LVM). Filesystem image formats,
like qcow, vmdk, vbox and so on may also have problems with atime.
