The same issue is still there for request-based dm.  See below.

Your understanding is correct, dm_wait_for_completion() for flush
will stall in such cases for request-based dm.
That's why I mentioned below in
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2010-August/msg00026.html.

    In other words, current request-based device-mapper can't handle
    other requests while a flush request is in progress.

In flush request handling, request-based dm uses dm_wait_for_completion()
to wait for the completion of cloned flush requests, depending on
the fact that there should be only flush requests in flight owning
to the block layer sequencing.

It's not a separate issue and we need to resolve it at least.
I'm still considering how I can fix the request-based dm.

Thanks,
Kiyoshi Ueda
