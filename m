Thanks for these.  It particularly helps when you identify how the flag might
be used - guiding GUI icon choice is certainly valid and tells me that if I
don't set the flag 'correctly' (maybe because it is too difficult) then it
isn't the end of the world.

I get the AUTOMOUNT distinction too - FS_AUTHMOUNT_ANY_FL would be good for a
GUI as it could allow you to type in a filename for it to try to follow.

I'm not sure exactly how FS_ENCRYPTED_FL would be used - if the gui might be
prompted to ask for a key there would either need to be a completely general
interface for presenting keys, or the flag should be specific to CIFS and
should mean that a key must be given to CIFS to unlock the file.

Similarly, what can you do with an OFFLINE file?  Do CIFS and AFS offline
files behave the same way?  If not there should be two different flags.  If
so then that behaviour should be specified with the flag ... unless this flag
is just for GUI cosmetics too.


Anyway, I've been thinking more about this and have refined my position
somewhat.  I'll present it here for what it is worth - feel free to ignore
bits you don't like.

Your proposed 'xstat' seems to combine a number of different goals - doing
that is always a bit dangerous as you have defend it on multiple fronts...

I see the separate goals are:
 A/ allowing attributes to be accessed independently - an explicit list of
    required attributes is given and the FS doesn't need to collect the other
    attributes.
 B/ allowing  synthetic attributes to be identified - if the FS doesn't
    natively support some attribute but must synthesise it, you can now
    discover that fact 
 C/ add an ad-hoc collection of new attributes that filesystems can return if
    they happen to support them
 D/ do all the above with a single system call for efficiency.

I think pushing all these together is asking for trouble - arguments about one
aspect will interfere with completion of the others.

Given that we already have the 'xattr' interface it seems most sensible to
achieve 'A' by defining xattr names for all 'standard' attributes and
handling them in a common library function.  Maybe 'linux.inum' to get the
inode numbers, etc.  There is doubtlessly a better name than 'linux.inum'.
I understand that you tried something like this before and it was rejected.
To borrow Linus's hyperbole from up-thread:
>> Hey, whoever denounced it as stupid obviously doesn't have the neurons
>> to go around to be involved in the discussion. Ignore them.

With that in place, 'B' can be achieved by the simple expedient of not
listing (in listxattr) the system attributes that the filesystem doesn't
support natively.  So if a filesystem doesn't support uid and has to fake it,
then it would not list 'linux.uid' in the xattr list, but will still return
the faked uid if explicitly asked for it.

The various proposed new attributes (C) could then be added one at a time or
as groups depending on how much opposition they receive.  Some might be
generic (linux.*) while others should possibly be filesystem-specific (FAT.*,
CIFS.*).

This could result in the need to make multiple system calls to get all of the
attributes that you want.  Maybe this would be a problem ... I keep hearing
that in Linux context switches are really cheap and system calls are also
really cheap, so maybe it isn't a problem.

However if you can demonstrate a cost in a credible workload you would then
have ammunition to defend a new syscall (D) which would get multiple xattrs.
And maybe one that would set multiple xattrs.

Thus you can address each goal one at a time and the more contentious parts
can be delayed without interfering with the clearly valuable parts.

Whether a particular attribute were stored in kstat, or whether the fs needed
extra disk access to get the attribute would be entirely internal details
which we are free to get wrong the first few times and then fix up once we
understand all the issues properly.

Yes, it seems that supporting the Windows behaviour is the only actual
use-case that has been suggested - so I think that we should be explicit that
this attribute has exactly the same semantics as the windows attribute.  i.e.
we shouldn't invent some, we should precisely copy them.

We do seem to suffer from the squeaky-wheel syndrome - the louder someone
complains the more attention they are given - I'm sorry I wasn't listening
when you first suggested using xattrs for accessing creation-time - maybe I
could have squeaked loudly too .... though probably I wouldn't have
considered the issues deeply enough by that time.

(Look - getxattr has buffer+buflen ! - it may well be disgusting, but
following established practice is good for consistency).

I understand that desire ... but with an interface, the docs really are just
as important as the code!
