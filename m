NFS will generally return a different error if the process catches a
fatal signal, so a soft mount should not be necessary and is not
recommended anyway...

In any case, we loop indefinitely now in the NFS code when (for
instance) there's a loss of communication. Users are not generally
happy if that causes an error, since their applications start dying.

While an ESTALE return is different, there are some parallels.

The question about looping indefinitely really comes down to:

1) is a persistent ESTALE in conjunction with a successful lookup a
situation that we expect to be temporary. i.e. will the admin at some
point be able to do something about it? If not, then there's no point
in continuing to retry. Again, this is a situation that *really* should
not happen if the filesystem is doing the right thing.

2) If the admin can't do anything about it, is it reasonable to expect
that users can send a fatal signal to hung applications if this
situation occurs.

We expect that that's ok in other situations to resolve hung
applications, so I'm not sure I understand why it wouldn't be
acceptable here...
