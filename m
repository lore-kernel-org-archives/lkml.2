That 1/2, or the 2/2 "ext4: let ext4_discard_partial_buffers handle
pages without buffers correctly"?  The latter is mostly a reversion
of your 02fac1297eb3, so that's the one I need to fix the oops and
rare data corruption.  Perhaps you're suggesting 1/2 for fsx failures
under memory pressure?

I've now tried the fsx test on three machines, with both 1/2 and 2/2
applied to 3.2-rc4.  On one machine, with ext2 on loop on tmpfs, the
fsx test failed in a couple of minutes with those patches; on another
machine, with ext2 on loop on tmpfs, it failed after about 40 minutes
with  the patches; on this laptop, with ext2 on SSD, it's just now
failed after 35 minutes with the patches.

That's not to say that Yongqiang's patches aren't good; but I cannot
detect whether they make any improvement or not, since lasting for 2 or
40 minutes is typical for fsx under memory pressure with recent kernels.
