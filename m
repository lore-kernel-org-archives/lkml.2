Right, it can be easily reproduced here. I'm running these writeback
performance tests:

        https://github.com/fengguang/writeback-tests

Which is basically doing N parallel dd writes to JBOD/RAID arrays on
various filesystems. It seems that the RAID test can reliably trigger
the problem.

Yes, I'm sure the patch fixed the bug. With the fix, the writeback
tests have run flawlessly for a dozen hours without any problem.

Thanks,
