They're 3.7 candidates yes (enhancements certainly aren't 3.6).  I seem
to have become lost with the virtio-scsi updates since what I have
marked for inclusion is a patch series that's a partial intersection
with this.  I'll flush my queue for virto-scsi, please resend all the
missing patches you want in 3.7.

Thanks,

James
