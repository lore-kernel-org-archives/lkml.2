There are other cases, less common than cifs and smb2.   One
that comes to mind is NFS version 4, but there are a few other
cases that I have heard of (backup/archive applications).
The RFC recommends that servers return attribute 50 (creation
time).  See below text:

   time_create         50   nfstime4       R/W      The time of creation
                                                    of the object.  This
                                                    attribute does not
                                                    have any relation to
                                                    the traditional UNIX
                                                    file attribute
                                                    "ctime" or "change
                                                    time".
