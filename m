Actually SCSI runtime PM uses PMSG_AUTO_AUTOSUSPEND, which is the same
as PMSG_SUSPEND except that the PM_EVENT_AUTO bit is also set in the
pm_message.event field.  Currently they _are_ compatible.

I don't know; this is a little questionable.

The point of this patch is to handle drivers that do different things
for runtime suspend and system sleep.  The only SCSI driver that
currently supports runtime suspend is sd, and it treats runtime suspend
the same as system sleep.  (Earlier I said it doesn't spin down disks
for runtime suspend -- that was wrong, it does.  It skips the spin-down
step only for PM_EVENT_FREEZE, which is part of the hibernation
procedure.)

Until other SCSI drivers support runtime suspend, this patch shouldn't 
be needed.  And spinning up runtime-suspended disks could add a lengthy 
delay to the system sleep transition, so it's better not to do this if 
at all possible.
