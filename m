Did you actually look Lukas FITRIM code (not the slight reordering here,
but the original one).  It's the ext4 version of the batched discard
model, that is a userspace ioctl to discard free space in the
filesystem.

hole punching will free the blocks into the free space pool.  If you do
online discard it will also get discarded, but a filesystem that has
online discard enabled doesn't need FITRIM.
