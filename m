Hello, Linus.

Please pull from the following branch to receive cgroup changes for
3.5-rc1.

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tj/cgroup.git for-3.5

cgroup file type addition / removal is updated so that file types are
added and removed instead of individual files so that dynamic file
type addition / removal can be implemented by cgroup and used by
controllers.  blkio controller changes which will come through block
tree are dependent on this.  Other changes include res_counter cleanup
and disallowing kthread / PF_THREAD_BOUND threads to be attached to
non-root cgroups.

There's a reported bug with the file type addition / removal handling
which can lead to oops on cgroup umount.  The issue is being looked
into.  It shouldn't cause problems for most setups and isn't a
security concern.

Merging with mainline causes a conflict in
feature-removal-schedule.txt.  Simple append collision which can be
trivially resolved.

Thanks.
