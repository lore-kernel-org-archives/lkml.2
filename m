Just my 2 cents (as a Samba server implementor). I *hate* the idea
of adding a "virtual" EA for birthtime. If you're going to add it,
just add it to the stat struct like *BSD does. Don't abuse the other
time fields, it's a new one.

Jeff, please don't advocate for an EA for the Samba server to use.
Don't add it as an EA. It's *not* an EA, it's a timestamp.

Jeremy.
