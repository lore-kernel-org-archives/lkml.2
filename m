Hi James,

For my education purposes, how will driver come to know that queue is
unused? Does it happen by checking if any requsts are queued or not? If
yes, we might run into issues with throttling logic.

For example, if some bio have been throttled and are queued in some data
structures on queue.  In that case driver does not even know that some bios
are queued and will be submitted later. Now if driver calls blk_cleanup_queue()
it might happen that throttling related worker is already queue lock and
trying to do some housekeeping or trying to dispatch bio etc. Now if queue
lock is swapped, it will just cause all the kind of issues.

I am wondering if we should retain blk_throtl_exit() in blk_cleanup_queue()
before lock swap and just move elevator cleanup in blk_release_queue().

A note to myself, I should probably enhance blk_throtl_exit() to look for any
queued throttled bio and single their completion with error (-ENODEV) or
something like that.

Thanks
Vivek
