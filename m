Since zcache is now one of its use cases, I think the major objection that
remains against cleancache is its intrusiveness -- in particular, need to
change individual filesystems (even though one liners). Changes below should
help avoid these per-fs changes and make it more self contained. I haven't
tested these changes myself, so there might be missed cases or other mysterious
problems:

1. Cleancache requires filesystem specific changes primarily to make a call to
cleancache init and store (per-fs instance) pool_id. I think we can get rid of
these by directly passing 'struct super_block' pointer which is also
sufficient to identify FS instance a page belongs to. This should then be used
as a 'handle' by cleancache_ops provider to find corresponding memory pool or
create a new pool when a new handle is encountered.

This leaves out case of ocfs2 for which cleancache needs 'uuid' to decide if a
shared pool should be created. IMHO, this case (and cleancache.init_shared_fs)
should be removed from cleancache_ops since it is applicable only for Xen's
cleancache_ops provider.

2. I think change in btrfs can be avoided by moving cleancache_get_page()
from do_mpage_reapage() to filemap_fault() and this should work for all
filesystems. See:

handle_pte_fault() -> do_(non)linear_fault() -> __do_fault()
						-> vma->vm_ops->fault()

which is defined as filemap_fault() for all filesystems. If some future
filesystem uses its own custom function (why?) then it will have to arrange for
call to cleancache_get_page(), if it wants this feature.

With above changes, cleancache will be fairly self-contained:
 - cleancache_put_page() when page is removed from page-cache
 - cleacacache_get_page() when PF occurs (and after page-cache is searched)
 - cleancache_flush_*() on truncate_*()

Thanks,
Nitin
