I'm not sure what you mean.  In the sd driver, PMSG_SUSPEND,
PMSG_HIBERNATE, and PMSG_AUTO_SUSPEND all do exactly the same thing.  
PMSG_FREEZE does a little less -- it doesn't spin down the drive.

> So we only need to runtime resume sd for PMSG_FREEZE case.

No, we don't.  PMSG_FREEZE does not care whether the drive is spinning
or not.  (That's why it skips the spin-down step.)  Therefore it's
silly to restart a stopped drive just in order to do a PMSG_FREEZE.

The 3 lines above aren't needed.

Of course, this leaves the patch in pretty much the same state as what 
Tejun objected to in

	http://marc.info/?l=linux-ide&m=132136894329965&w=2

I think this email discussion has answered his objection: The only SCSI
top-level driver implementing runtime suspend is sd, and sd treats
runtime suspend the same as system sleep.  It might be a good idea to
add a comment with this explanation along with the new code, however.
