Heh, please go ahead and nitpick.  That's one of the main purposes of

Not only that, pid changes, sighand struct may get swapped, and other
weird things which aren't usually expected for a live task happen.
It's basically semi-killed and then resurrected.

Hmm... an exec'ing task goes through transitions which usually aren't
allowed to happen.  It assumes exclusive access to group-shared data
structures and may ditch the current one and create a new one.

Sure, it's possible to make every cgroup method correct w.r.t. all
those via explicit locking or by being more careful but I don't see
much point in such excercise.  If the code is sitting in some hot path
and the added exclusion is gonna add significant amount of contention,
sure, we should trade off easiness for better performance /
scalability but this is for cgroup modifications, a fundamentally cold
path, and the added locking is per-task or per-threadgroup.  I don't
see any reason not to be easy here.

Please read on.

I don't remove tasklist_lock.

This is the same story.  Yes, we can narrow the locking and try to
make sure everyone handles partially destroyed tasks properly in all
methods, but for what?  If we can give stable threadgroups to all
cgroup methods without introducing performance or scalability
bottleneck, that's the right thing to do.  Please also note that bugs
stemming from failure to handle those corner cases properly will be
subtle, difficult to reproduce and track down.

In general, for any subsystem with pluggable interface, I think it's
best to put as much complexity as possible into the core layer to make
things eaiser for its customers.  It becomes excruciatingly painful if
the API invites subtle corner case bugs and the subsystem grows
several dozen clients down the road.

So, to me, what seems more important is how to make it easier for each
cgroup client instead of what's the minimal that's necessary right
now.

Heh, did I make any sense? :)

Thanks.
