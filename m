Ok, then I shall convert transport_generic_[unmap,write_same]() which
currently call blk_issue_discard() directly from IBLOCK code, and turn
the ->do_discard() subsystem API op into the LBA+Range subsystem call
with the underlying IBLOCK specific call to blk_issue_discard().

Yes, this is what transport_generic_unmap() is currently doing when
called from iblock_do_discard() an walks the received UNMAP payload.

Agreed.

I have not gotten around to the async discard caller just yet, but this
is straight-forward enough for the next round..

Understood.  In that case I will go ahead and drop the FILEIO discard
support all together for .37 code, and we can revist as necessary down
the road.
