The bio layer isn't well documented, so a lot of this was written by
cargo cult programming.  In this case, I was following what XFS did
when I originally wrote it.  It's only in the past week when I've been
diving deep into the source and was able to conclude that yes, it's
only needed for the ASSERT.

One of the frustrating things about the bio layer is that all of the
different file systems use very different patterns about how they
access the bio layer --- which is perhaps caused by the lack of
documentation.  But I finally did notice that the JFS code dodn't do a
bio_get() after calling bio_alloc(), and it was only when I did a lot
of source code tracing that I realized that it strictly speaking the
ASSERT isn't really even all that necessary, since we're not calling
using a discard or barrier op, which is the only thing that could
possibly set the EOPNOTSUPP flag anyway....

Copied exactly from the XFS code.  I was under the (possibly mistaken)
assumption that the XFS code was a good place to copy from, since
everyone sings the praises of XFS.....

I do agree that bio_alloc() should be allowed to fail, although life
gets really tough deep in the writeback stack to throw a failure all
the way back out.  This was on my todo list to fix, after I got things
basically working.
