Sorry. I've been caught up in work in the past few days.

I can certainly help with the soft lockup if you are able to supply
either a dump that includes all threads stuck in the NFS, or a (binary)
wireshark dump that shows the NFSv4 traffic between the client and
server around the time of the hang.

Cheers
