Yes, it can delay destroy_pid_namespace(), sure. OK, I am not going
to argue. I never said this fix is perfect. I'll be wating for the
better fix.

I don't see any conflicts, but perhaps I missed something.

I understand, but I think it should be 5/6.

I disagree here. Sure, it is unnecessary, and I already said this.
I added it to simply document the fact that find_pid() can't work if
MS_KERNMOUNT is set, to me this certainly makes the code more
understandable to the reader.
