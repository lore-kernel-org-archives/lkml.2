FYI, I've seen the "fileid changed" problem, and it looked like a 32-bit
truncation of the fileid.  It occurred several times on successive
reboots, so I tried to capture a tcpdump trace off the server (Linux
2.6.23-rc8-ga64314e6 - its ancient because I've had issues with buggy
IDE drivers trying to move it forward.)  However, for the last couple
of weeks I've been unable to reproduce it.

The client was based on 2.6.37-rc6.

The "fileid changed" messages popped up after mounting an export with
'nolock,intr,rsize=4096,soft', and then trying to use bash completion
and 'ls' in a few subdirectories - and entries were missing from the
directory lists without 'ls' reporting any errors (which I think is bad
behaviour in itself.)

I don't know why it's stopped producing the errors, although once it
went I never investigated it any further (was far too busy trying to
get AMBA DMA support working.)
