Yeah, something along that line.

That means it _can_ be done there but doesn't mean it's the best spot.

I don't think anyone would need such capability but even if someone
does that should be implemented as a separate explicit
DONT_MERGE_THIS_FLUSH flag, not by exploting subtle inconsistencies on
the wrapper interface.

And the third point is completely nuts.  That's like saying putting
things related together makes the concentrated code more complex, so
let's scatter things all over the place.  No, it's not making the code
more complex.  It's putting the complexity where it belongs.  It
decreases maintenance overhead by increasing consistency.  Not only
that it even results in visibly more consistent and sane _behavior_
and the said complex machinary is less than 300 lines long.

No, not at all.  You're adding an unobvious logic into a wrapper
interface creating incosistent behavior and creating artificial
distinctions between pure and non-pure flushes and flushes issued by
bio and the wrapper interface.  Come on.  Think about it again.  You
can't be seriously standing by the above rationales.

Thanks.
