Great, thanks for testing that. Would you be able to test this patch on
2.6.39 kernel? It should apply cleanly there, but let me know if it
doesn't.

Also, I'm planning to send this off to stable@kernel.org if there are no
objections, so if anyone has any, let me know ASAP.

cifs: fix wsize negotiation for 2.6.39 stable

Prior to 2.6.39, when signing was enabled on a socket the client only
sent single-page writes. This changed with commit ca83ce3d5b, which
made signed and unsigned connections use the same codepaths for write
calls.

This caused a regression when working with windows servers. Windows
machines will reject writes larger than the MaxBufferSize when signing
is active, but does not clear the CAP_LARGE_WRITE_X flag in the
negotiation.

This patch backports 2 patches that fix this problem in 3.0 kernels,
and changes a couple of the constants to values appropriate for the
writeback code in 2.6.39.
