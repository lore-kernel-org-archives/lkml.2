Bruce hi.

As I recall this failure I have experienced in early stages of the
3.1-rcX series. I admit that I always run with Benny's pnfs tree,
but I do not think it is patches that Benny added from the 3.2 set
I think it is breakage introduced by the 3.1 merge window.

Therefor I think that this patch must be sent to Stable@ otherwise
surly 3.1 Kernel users are to hit it. (You can escapee it)

Though it has been pulled to Linus tree, without the CC: stable@kernel
I think you can just send the patch to <stable@kernel.org> and it
will be included.

(What other 3.1 bug fixes are missing)

Thanks
Boaz
