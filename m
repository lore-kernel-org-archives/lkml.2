The only difference between your above example of requeue after
cancel_delayed_work_sync, and this here is the visit back to the
slab. Does the slab (Maybe in debug mode) stumps over some of the
record memory?

If the memory is constant what is then the difference between the two
cases?

That depends on the API intention. If an init is intended after
SLAB free then yes if not then not. We should ask for the intention
of this API.

You mean other fix then calling INIT_DELAYED_WORK? is that so
bad that we need more code to avoid it?

Thanks
