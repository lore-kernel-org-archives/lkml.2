I think it's about the third time in the thread this has been said but
just in case anyone else missed it: TRIM != SECURE ERASE.
TRIM/UNMAP/WRITE_SAME are used to provide optional information about
which blocks the filesystem doesn't care about.  They have no bearing on
information security which is preserved by separate mechanisms.
