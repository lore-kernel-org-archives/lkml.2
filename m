Subject: [PATCH -V3 00/17]  New ACL format for better NFSv4 acl

Hi,

The following set of patches implements a new acl model for linux. Rich ACLs
are an implementation of NFSv4 ACLs, extended by file masks to fit into the
standard POSIX file permission model.  They are designed to work seamlessly
locally as well as across the NFSv4 and CIFS/SMB2 network file system protocols.

The patch set consists of three parts:

The first set of patches, posted as a follow up, contains the Rich ACL model
and Ext4 implementation. The second set [1] contains mapping of Rich ACL to
NFSv4 ACL (how to apply file mask to access mask) and implementation of
Richacl ACL for NFS server and client. The third set [2] contains POSIX ACL
to Rich ACL mapping and its ext4 usage.

[2] git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/agruen/linux-2.6-richacl.git richacl-fullset

A user-space utility for displaying and changing richacls is available at [3]
(a number of examples can be found at http://acl.bestbits.at/richacl/examples.html).

[3] git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/agruen/richacl.git master

To test richacl on ext4 use -o richacl mount option. This mount option may later be
dropped in favour of a feature flag.

More details regarding richacl can be found at 
http://acl.bestbits.at/richacl/

Changes from V2:
1) Git repo include check-acl branch that drop newly added inode_operations
   callback in favour for additional access check flags (MAY_CREATE_FILE,
   MAY_CREATE_DIR, MAY_DELETE_CHILD, MAY_DELETE_SELF, MAY_TAKE_OWNERSHIP,
   MAY_CHMOD, and MAY_SET_TIMES)
2) richacl is now cached in the vfs inode instead of file system inode.
   (currently kept as a separate patch. We may want to fold that later)
3) Added a new acl flag ACL4_MASKED. richacl_apply_masks() can skip transforming acls
   without this flag, which speeds things up and avoids modifying those acls unnecessarily.
4) Owner always allowed permissions are now explicitly included when synthesizing an acl
   from file mode.

Changes from V1:
1) Split the patches into smaller patches
2) Added extensive documentation to the patches.
