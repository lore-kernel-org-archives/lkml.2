Driver needs to call flush_scheduled_work() because you are adding in this patch a new workqueue:
INIT_WORK(&instance->work_init, process_fw_state_change_wq); so calling the flush_scheduled_work()
only if a certain condition is met is the problem. If the condition comes true for both workqueues
then it would be fine, but I think that it isn't so.
With this patch we could have a started workqueue (with a long 30 sec sleep) and when the module
is removed then probably a memory corruption etc.

I would prefer to have it in one patch, but if it is for you easier, then do it as you wish.
