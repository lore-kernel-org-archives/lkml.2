I strongly disagree with this approach. The callee often don't know what 
happen after and before the call. The same is true for the programmer, 
because the code is quite often updated by several people. A clean 
exit() is the right thing to do as general rule. I don't see any valid 
reason (in the btrfs context) to do otherwise.

Relying on the exit() for a proper clean-up increase the likelihood of 
bug when the code evolves (see my patch   [RESPOST][BTRFS-PROGS][PATCH] 
btrfs_read_dev_super(): uninitialized variable for an example of what 
means an incorrect deallocation of resource).

May be I am wrong, but I don't think that the increase of speed of the 
btrfs "command" is even measurable relying on exit instead of free()-ing 
each chunk of memory one at time.... The same should be true for the 
open()/close()

My 2¢
