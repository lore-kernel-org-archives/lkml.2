Ok, so I suspect the problem is the pushing down of the locks which
breaks with iommu backends that have a separate flush callback. In
that case, the flush moves out of the allocator lock.

Now we do call flush before we return, still, but it becomes racy
I suspect, but somebody needs to give it a closer look. I'm hoping
Anton or Nish will later today.

Cheers,
Ben.
