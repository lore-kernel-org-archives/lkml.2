Oh, huh.  And we can't "unshare" it somehow?

Or, previously you suggested:

	- introduce sockaddr_fd that can be applied to AF_UNIX sockets,
	  and teach unix_bind and unix_connect how to deal with a second
	  type of sockaddr, AT_FD:
	  struct sockaddr_fd { short fd_family; short pad; int fd; }

	- introduce sockaddr_unix_at that takes a directory file
	  descriptor as well as a unix path, and teach unix_bind and
	  unix_connect to deal with a second sockaddr type, AF_UNIX_AT:
	  struct sockaddr_unix_at { short family; short pad; int dfd; char path[102]; }

Any other options?

Sorry, I don't know much about devtmpfs, are you suggesting it as a
model?  What exactly should we look at?

--b.
