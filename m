I think the solution for the kernel direct mapping problem is to take
the expected flushes and invalidates into kmap/kunmap[_atomic].  I think
the original reason for not doing this was efficiency:  the user should
know what they did with the data (i.e. if they're only reading it, it
doesn't need to be flushed on unmap).  However, the difficulty of
getting all this right seems to outweigh the efficiency of only using
the necessary flushing.  At least on some architectures, we can look at
the TLB flags to see if the page was dirtied (and only flush if it was).
