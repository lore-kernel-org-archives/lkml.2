1. It's not a new failure mode.  it's how things worked before 2.6.34
2. My ticket usualy expires in the middle of the night.  I get back in 
the morning and have to reboot the workstation because it's hung.  
Anything left in the wordprocessor is lost.

Before this change I got back in the morning, the unlock screen popped 
up, I entered my password and got a new ticket, everyone was happy.
