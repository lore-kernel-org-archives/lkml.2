???

Not "not print", but print in "crypted" form.  The information is
still not lost, you can obviously restore it to the original form, with
some effort, but possible.  Compare it with the harm of log spoofing -
it is not "restorable".

The *fact* is you/anybody/everybody might not know all bad things.  If
you just don't care because it is yet unknown then you will be
vulnerable as soon as it disclosured.

Do you know the principle "Attacks always get better, never worse"?  If
you are protected against only of known attack, you will be vulnerable
to *every* danger not known to you.

Maybe you don't know, but it is really possible to be protected against
some *yet unknown* attack techniques.  (The assessment of what attacks it
protects against is undefined too, though.)  And upstream Linux is *already*
protected against some *yet unknown* bugs, not the whole bug classes,
but at least small kinds of it.

No, I was - only ascii chars and \n are allowed.  In v2 all ascii chars,
the upper charset and 2 control chars are allowed.  Rather clear, IMO.
