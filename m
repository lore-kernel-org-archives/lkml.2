Randy Hi

I think I prefer this simple solution for now, instead of
the complete move of the ore to lib/

It solves the warning problem you reported and let us
keep the convenience of selecting everything in one place. As
was said there are more dependencies on the way.

I will look into the additional ASYNC_CORE and XOR_BLOCKS selects
you mentioned. For some reason it works but I'll try to find a
way to break it or prove It is sound.

Please advise?

Thanks
