I'm surprised you would make NFS exports devices

USB gadgets are a good example, but not quite.

I'm objecting not the possibility to implement SCST objects as devices.
We are creating software, so all what hardware allows can be implemented.

I'm arguing usage of devices view for something which fundamentally not
devices.

USB gadgets are subset of what SCST allows. On the external side they
are tightly coupled to hardware, on the backend side they don't need any
management interface, because (at least for storage) all devices
configuration they have is static via module parameters. The only
attributes file_storage has are to change FUA and file path, which can
be placed anywhere, including /sys/module/g_file_storage/parameters.

So, for USB gadgets the config interface and place in /sys doesn't
matter much. I guess, making its LUNs as Linux devices were just part of
the ritual to get accepted into the kernel. On the USB gadgets
developers place I wouldn't mind too to go this way.

But SCST is a _big_, _complete_, _new_ Linux subsystem. Actually, USB
storage gadgets should be SCST targets to use full power of all possible
virtual and real backends SCST provides, hence stay inside SCST subtree.

For SCST it is very important that all its functionality concentrated in
one place and not confused with other client side devices Linux has.
Important for clearness, easy to use, easy to understand, flexibility,
maintainability, etc.

It's like as you created rules to keep and train dogs. Then you need to
keep and train cats as well. Would it be wise to keep cats in the same
place together with dogs and train them the same tricks using the same
rules as dogs?

If you have such wide devices definition, why file systems have separate
/sys/fs namespace? Or ksm place in /sys/kernel/mm/ksm? Or hugepages in
/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages?

If NFS exports are devices, file systems must also be devices, correct?

Like /sys/fs/ext4/sda11. Isn't it a full analogy to NFS export
/home/user/shared_dir?

Well, if I don't agree with you it doesn't mean I'm not listening to
you. I do. Very carefully.

Thanks,
