Sleeping isn't the problem as long as you sleep with the page locked.
The idea is that writepage will:

1) lock the page
2) clear_page_dirty_for_io (which calls page_mkclean)
3) set_page_writeback()
4) unlock the page
5) start the IO

page_mkwrite will:

1) lock the page
2) wait on page writeback
3) do other stuff

So if ext is calling set_page_writeback() on an unlocked page, that's a
problem.  Otherwise it should be working.
