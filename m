Do you remember which workload this was?  I do remember someone
mentioning a specific workload, but can't recall which one now.  fsx is
definitely slower when we wait for writeback, but that's because it's
all evil inside.

Rewrites in flight should be very rare though, and I think the bouncing
is going to have a big impact on the intended workloads.  It's not just
the cost of the copy, it's also the increased time as we beat on the
page allocator.

We're working on adding stable pages to ext34 and other filesystems
missing it.  When the work is done we can benchmark and decide on the
tradeoffs.
