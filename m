Well, I thought bisecting between 2.6.32 and 3.0 will be quite
painful...  But I'll try if nothing else helps.  And no, I haven't
tried anything in-between.

Yes.

Yes, it works flawlessly, all other protocols works so far.

To the date, I resorted to using a small webserver plus wget as an ugly
workaround for the problem - http works for reads from the server, while
nfs works for writes.

The network load is irrelevant - it behaves the same way with
100% idle network or with network busy doing other stuff.

> Does NFSv3 behave the same way?

Yes it does.  With all NFSDs on server eating all available CPUs for
quite some time, and with being "ghosts" for perf top.

And with the client being unkillable again.

Can at least the client be made interruptible?  Mounting with
-o intr,soft makes no visible difference...
