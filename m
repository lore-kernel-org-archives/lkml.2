Hi.
There is no upper/lower case table on nls utf8. so If you use iocharset=utf8,
filesystem will be case sensitive.
so we can add upper/lower case table like other charset.
And Currently surrogate pair is not working on nls utf8.
because it is limited by MAX_WCHAR_T in nls utf8
I think that upper/lower case table and surrogate pair support should
be fixed on nls utf8.
I should know Andrew's opinion to fix these problem.
