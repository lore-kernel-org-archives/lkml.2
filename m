I have implemented and posted patches for per bdi per cgroup congestion
flag. The only problem I see with that is that a group might be congested
for a long time because of lots of other IO happening (say direct IO) and
if you keep on backing off and never submit the metadata IO (transaction),
you get starved. And if you go ahead and submit IO in a congested group,
we are back to serialization issue.

I guess throttling at bdi layer will take care of network filesystem
case too?  But isn't the notion of "bdi" internal to kernel and user does
not really program thing in terms of bdi.

Also per bdi limit mechanism will not solve the issue of global throttling
where in case of btrfs an IO might go to multiple bdi's. So throttling limits
are not total but per bdi.

Thanks
