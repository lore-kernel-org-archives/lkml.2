Sorry, but I don't buy it.

Wait, why shouldn't the release then free the memory?

I don't understand, why can't you just free the memory, what are you
having to wait for?

You are only having one kobject for your structure, right?  If so, then
free the memory in the release, to wait for something else to free the
memory is wrong.

As no other kernel code is like this, I don't think it's valid to be
doing so, sorry.

Please fix this.

good luck,
