Sorry, forgot to address the -stable part of the question.

This series is dependent on the ext4 change to use it's own
writepage going into -stable first.  (i.e.
8e48dcfbd7c0892b4cfd064d682cc4c95a29df32 "ext4: Use our own
write_cache_pages()").

I'd suggest that all 4 patches (the ext4 patch and the three in this
series) should go back to 2.6.34-stable due to the long term affect
this writeback bug could have on XFS filesystems, and the sync
taking too long problem has been fairly widely reported since at
least .32...

Cheers,

Dave.
