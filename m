Hi Ted,

Did you get any time to look into this patch?
This problem is with ext4 only as ext4_truncate does not clean the
orphan list unlike that of ext3_truncate.
Instead, in case of failure to obtain handle, orphan list cleanup is
done in ext4_setattr.
But during mount, ext4_truncate is not called via ext4_setattr and
hence the problem.
What do you think?
