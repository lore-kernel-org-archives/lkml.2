Filesystems are way more complex than the block layer - the block
layer simply doesn't have to handle situations were thread X is
holding A, B and C, while thread Y needs C to complete the
transaction. thread Y is the user of the low memory pool, but has
almost depleted it and so even if we swith to thread X, the pool doe
snot have enouhg memory for X to complete and allow us to switch
back to Y and have it complete, freeing the memory from the pool
that it holds.

That is, the guarantee that we will always make progress simply does
not exist in filesystems, so a mempool-like concept seems to me to
be doomed from the start....

Cheers,

Dave.
