FWIW, I'd prefer to have all that done inside __audit_syscall_entry(),
with
        context->arch       = syscall_get_arch(current, regs);
        context->major      = syscall_get_nr(current, regs);
	syscall_get_arguments(current, regs, 0, 4, context->argv);
done instead of initializations from arguments we are doing there now.
I seriously doubt that it would lead to worse code than what we currently
have.  If nothing else, we won't be passing that pile of arguments around.

And yes, asm/syscall.h stuff is probably the right approach here.  For
biarch ones syscall_get_arguments() is saner than doing them one by one...
