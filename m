That would result in a more complex patch than the patch at the start of
this thread, isn't it ? Also, IMHO it would help to document which
functions in the scsi-ml are called with an sdev reference and which
ones not. That would make the scsi-ml code easier to verify for issues
like the one reported at the start of this thread.
