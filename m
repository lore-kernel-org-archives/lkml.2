As Jeff notes, large file sequential read of one file at a time is going
to be cifs kernel client's worst case.   An earlier cifs async patchset
(prototype) showed dramatic improvements so it is not
inherent in the protocol and I am looking forward to seeing
Jeff's patches for this.

With multiple processes reading/writing cifs does pretty well
(since the worst case serialization is in cifs_readpages,
coupled with the relatively small buffer size on reads), as long as
you are accessing various files at one time.   I have seen
cifs beat nfs on broader tests such as dbench when lots of activity on the
wire from multiple processes - but meant to do a dbench run
on recent kernels to compare.   Would be interesting to compare
dbench now (with e.g. more than 30 processes) on nfs mount to
cifs mount.
