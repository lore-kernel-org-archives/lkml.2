I'm sorry, but I just don't buy it.

Then don't abuse kobjects with this "different" type of kobject, as that
is not how the kobject code was designed to be used.

It was only designed to be used with the "sane" type of kernel objects
:)

That sounds like an implementation error.  No other kernel code has that
problem from what I can see.

ext4 is using this to get stuff under the /sys/fs/ext4 location.  And
even there, I don't think it is using kobjects correctly, but I really
don't want to go audit that code at the moment.

cpufreq and cpuidle is also probably incorrect, but again, I don't feel
like auditing it right now.

Basically, don't copy bad examples as a valid usage model for the code.

It's wrong and should be fixed then.

No, you should be using a struct device as you are putting stuff into
the device tree.  NEVER put a kobject into the device tree, that is just
wrong and will cause problems.
