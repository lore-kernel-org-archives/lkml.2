Yes.

Hmm, you mentioned Veritas and that reminds me of
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=740504.  If that is the
case, the filesystem is simply pinging the destination with INQUIRY
commands, something for which it would be worthwhile to have a
non-privileged ioctl anyway.

Yes, forbidding SG_IO commands on some disks would be nice.  Still,
partition/non-partition is an important distinction.  If you pass a
whole disk and give CAP_SYS_RAWIO to QEMU, the guest may do some damage
but not more than what a bare-metal system could do.  If you pass a
partition, the guest can stomp on other VMs or the host's data and even
write them, which is a security problem.

So you could add a more restrictive filter to partitions, but then
you're adding hack above hack to justify a wrong decision.

If you implement a yes/no toggle, some use case will pop up later for
filters (in fact, a rudimentary filter based on CAP_SYS_RAWIO is
_already_ in the kernel which already proves this).
