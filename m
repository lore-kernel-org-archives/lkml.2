"Growable" virtual disks benefit from it too, if it frees up a lot of space.

Windows has some ability to trim unused space in NTFS on virtual disks
for this reason; I'm not sure if it's an online or offline procedure.

Online trim may be slow, but offline would be awfully inconvenient
when an fs is big and needed for a live system, or when it's your root fs.
