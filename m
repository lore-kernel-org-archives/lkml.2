I'm a bit late to the party, but I have such a use case.  I have a 
real-time program that generates logs.  There's a thread that makes sure 
that there are always mlocked, MAP_SHARED, writable pages for the logs, 
and under normal (or even very heavy) load, the mlocked pages always 
stay far ahead of the logs.  On 2.6.39, it works great [1].  On 3.0, 
it's unusable -- latencies of 30-100 ms are very common.

In this case, neither throughput nor available memory matter at all -- 
I'm not stressing either.  So copying the pages (especially if they're 
mlocked) would be more than a small percentage win -- it would be the 
difference between great performance and unusability.

I wonder if we want a stronger version of mlock that says "this page 
must not be swapped out and, in addition, ptes must always be mapped 
with all appropriate permission bits set".  (This is only possible with 
hardware dirty and accessed bits, but we could come close even without 
them.)


[1] file_update_time is a problem.  patches coming.
