At the moment its a callback function with two params so that 
filesystems are free to override it while mounting. This is to support 
filesystem specific information at mount time.

nfs uses it to get its server specific information. btrfs uses it to 
populate its filesystem information. So the signature can not be changed 
without affecting these filesystems.

sysfs, ceph, 9p will also be affected if we are to change the signature.
