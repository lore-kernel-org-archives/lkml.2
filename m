This is going to give massive conflicts with

 https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/3/2/286
 https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/3/2/282

which I was planning to stuff into .40

DEF_TIMESLICE is SCHED_RR only, so its use here is dubious at best, also
I bet we have something like NSEC_PER_SEC to avoid counting '0's.

While that puts a limit on things it'll still waste time. I'd much
rather pass an trylock argument to mutex_spin_on_owner() and then bail
on owner also spinning.

While we did our best with making local_clock() cheap, I'm still fairly
uncomfortable with putting it in such a tight loop.
