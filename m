Hmmm...  Actually, I doubt it would bother any SATLs, but it might well
bother other sorts of USB translation layers.  No way to tell without
trying it, and I don't really want to deal with the fallout.

Maybe a better question to be asking is this: What happens when one of 
these drives (the ones that report their caching capabilities 
incorrectly) is plugged into a Windows system?
