Um, the same way it does in your new code: inside the executed function.

Well, if that's an actual problem, your patch doesn't solve it.  In both
cases the work structure is part of the object that will be released.
The way it should happen is that workqueues dequeue the work (so now no
refs) and execute the callback with the data, so the callback is OK to
free the work structure.  As long as it still does that, there's no
problem in either case.

But you're thinking of it as a workqueue issue ... it isn't, it's an API
which says "just make sure I have user context".  The workqueue is just
the implementation detail.

As I said: the required open coding then becomes error prone.
