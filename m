A driver version should never show up down here in sysfs, use the proper
place for this like the rest of the kernel's drivers do (hint, look at
MODULE_VERSION() and where that ends up, in your module's sysfs
directory.)

2.6.39 was released already, is this file in that release?

Why would a user, or anyone else, ever want to be able to change this?
Why wouldn't this just be something that the driver handles
automagically so the user never has to worry about it at all?

You also don't specify the units involved here, which is not good.

See, when you document things, it's easier to notice when you did
something you didn't need to do (i.e. the driver version thing).  :)
