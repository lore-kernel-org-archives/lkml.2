  OK, I've missed this. I'll fix it.

  Sure. But reclaim will start a transaction only if inode is dirty. And
inode must not be dirty on a frozen filesystem.

  Yes, it would be a bug if something dirtied a journal while the
filesystem is frozen. To catch issues like this, I've added WARN_ON in
xfs_trans_alloc() to actually warn when transaction would be started on a
frozen filesystem. My testing never triggered it with the latest patch set.

  Yes. I'd just note that the "shell" is there already to provide reliable
remounting read only. I just had to change some properties of the shell to
be usable for freezing as well. But the shell has to be maintained
regardless of how we decide to do freezing.

Also believe me that I've initially tried to fix the freezing without the
external shell. But it just isn't enough to prevent dirty inodes from being
created (e.g. from directory operations) while sync during freezing is
running.

Sure I could keep the freezing mechanism on transaction start. But it
seemed like a cleaner approach to me to protect all the places properly
with the generic mechanism than having two mechanisms and unclear
(especially locking) interactions between them.

But in the end, if you guys really feel strongly about it and decide that
XFS wants to keep it's mechanism of freezing on transaction start, then I
won't stop you. Although it would mean XFS would have to have three
counters to protect freezing while other filesystems will need only two.
Anyway I'm confident enough to remove that mechanism from ext3/4 and ocfs2
but I don't know XFS internals enough to really argue...

  Yes, but all these ioctls are currently buggy with respect to remounting
read only (not the whole filesystem, just one mountpoint of many where
filesystem may be mounted). So I'd argue that these particular changes are
actually bug fixes.

  OK, now I see that even iput() of a clean inode can cause truncation to
happen for XFS. Thanks for the pointer. I'll see what we could do about
this.

  Well, actually I don't know filesystem which would have as complex
interactions as XFS has. But maybe there are some. In either case I don't
think maintaining the "shell" is that hard. You have to maintain the one
facing to userspace anyway due to remounting. For the internal filesystem
threads, you have to be aware when you can cause write and be protected
against freezing in that case. I don't think it's that complex, although I
agree that the current test coverage will be small (freezing isn't used
very often) so bugs can go unnoticed for a long time.

Maybe we could add a test in xfs_trans_alloc() checking that fs is
protected against freezing? That would increase the test coverage a lot.
Although the test should be probably enabled only for XFS_DEBUG because it
will be an expensive one.
