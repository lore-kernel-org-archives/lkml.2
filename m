Bored of this.  I've explained half a dozen times my attitude here.
Both LIO and SCST are mature projects spanning most of the last decade.

Look, let me try to make it simple:  It's not about the community you
bring to the table, it's about the community you have to join when you
become part of the linux kernel.  The interactions in the wider
community are critical to the success of an open source project.  You've
had the opportunity to interact with a couple of them:  sysfs we've
covered elsewhere, but in the STGT case you basically said, here's our
interface, use it. LIO actually asked what they wanted and constructed
something to fit.  Why are you amazed then when the STGT people seem to
prefer LIO?

You've also spent a lot of time doing ad hominem attacks on people who
you think disagree with you.  Christoph can be abrasive and sometimes a
little tactless, but he's not often wrong on technical issues, and when
he is he's usually amenable to technical argument.  He gave both LIO and
SCST pointers about improvements.  LIO implemented enough that he felt
comfortable sending in fairly radical cleanup patches ... again, it's no
real surprise he prefers LIO to work with.

Basically, in the years we've been at this, you've failed to convince
any of the key people I rely on to help maintain SCSI to advocate for
SCST or even to send in patches for it ... they all seem to be either
neutral or leaning towards LIO.

You see conspiracy in this ... I just see LIO being accommodating to
their technical needs.

Yes, we are ... but I don't think you appreciate whose.

Oh come on ... this one's been over the lists and Mike and Tomo have
actually approved of the LIO solution for them

I looked at the code fairly carefully and didn't find this ... where is
it?

Essentially, I did ... it has.
