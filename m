Not as far as I know...  I think autofs is the only one doing out-of-kernel
automounting.

That doesn't mean it shouldn't be provided, though...

Seems redundant, but I'd say go with it for now.  Maybe we can offload
S_AUTOMOUNT to the dentry.

I'm not sure that would actually matter, since it would come to
follow_automount() at the same place.

Note that someone who tries to stat() with AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT will cause the call
to d_automount() to be suppressed and will see the negative or non-mounted
directory.  That might be okay for you.
