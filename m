The patches were good, but don't mislead people about that. For sake of 
clearness, what you called "the passthrough for STGT compatibility with 
TCM_Loop via SG_IO and BSG" has nothing with LIO/TCM_Loop. What merged 
fixed problems STGT had in the pass-through implementation. It at the 
same time fixed problems with SCST's scst_local, so similarly can be 
called "the passthrough for STGT compatibility with scst_local via SG_IO 
and BSG".

The same is for the second half of the above. It's for scst_local in the 
same degree as for TCM_Loop.

Does it look I'm arguing? Again, I'm analyzing and asking for 
clarification in the contradictions I see. I don't like when such 
important decisions are done behind closed doors and kept in a secret.

Well, Nicholas, are you really understanding what you are writing? We in 
our projects have fully the same distributed (or centralized, if you 
like it) development model. Have you noticed how many developers SCST 
project has? We have our responsibility areas (target drivers, 
scstadmin, etc.) and commit in them. The way how we get updates for the 
rest of the kernel doesn't matter. Git is better for such huge projects 
as the kernel, but for our relatively small and centralized by nature 
due to small size (sub)projects it doesn't matter and won't bring any value.

Actually, to have all in one place without the rest of the kernel is 
more convenient, because grep over few MBs is a lot faster than over the 
few hundreds of MBs of the full kernel sources.

SF.net for a long time has been offering git hosting, but we don't see 
reasons to move to it. SVN has all we need. We are not (yet) so big to 
need git.

But, we can move to git at any moment as soon as it is needed, for 
instance, because of SCST merged in the mainline kernel.

Does STGT represent it in an insane manner?

I have no doubts in benefits to TCM. But I have asked about benefits 
_for an average user_. STGT already can do what you listed above.

Also what advantages and additional value it has over what SCST 
*already* provides since 2007?

So, do you believe that as soon as we migrate to git all the obstacles 
for the SCST merge would be immediately removed?
