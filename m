Well... on my fsync-happy workloads, this seems to cut the barrier count down
by about 20%, and speeds it up by about 20%.

I also have a patch to ext4_sync_files that batches the fsync requests together
for a further 20% decrease in barrier IOs, which makes it run another 20%
faster.  I'll send that one out shortly, though I've not safety-tested it at
all.
