Yes, this is more-or-less exactly I have been doing for the .38 round. 

This particular series could stand to have a few more minor commit's
squashed together, and a quick run through checkpatch as well.  But
other that these small items, the commits have been made tidy, with
intelligible changelogs + proper authorship with target v4.0.0-rc7
running in .38-rc2 x86_64 VM, and the bugfixes ready to be included for
mainline.

Squashing will probably save only 2-3 commits in this particular series,
but I will get these minor items condensed and produce a followup GIT
PULL v2 request from scsi-post-merge-2.6.git/for-38-rc3 against
linus .38-rc2.

Again just to verify, these will be sent out in their entirety to
linux-scsi.
