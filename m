The motivation stems from research how the integrity data can be
mapped to the hardware interface used by the zfcp driver. When passing
data segments to the zfcp hardware controller, there is the constraint
that each data segment has a maximum size of 4k and a segment must not
cross a 4k boundary. Right now, this is done by reporting the
maximum segment size and segment boundary accordingly from zfcp. When
issuing a request, zfcp simply walks the sg list and passes the
segments to the hardware controller, no mapping or readjustment is
necessary in the driver.

Adding integrity data to this interface implies that the integrity
data segments are passed the same way and with the same restrictions.
integrity data segments.  In fact, i am planning to post an
experimental patch for zfcp for upstream inclusion. While this is
still research, it does not affect non-integrity I/O and it will ease
future work on the integrity data mapping for zfcp.

Maybe my thinking is too much with the zfcp hardware interface where
it is obvious to have the same constraints for everything passed along
to the hardware. Another motivation is that i do not want to have the
need in the driver to re-map or copy data segments, when the block
layer already has a generic method of doing this.

What would be the right approach for hardware that has specific
constraints for integrity data? Add an interface for reporting
integrity data constraints independently of constraints for regular
data?

Meaning the integrity data sg list would have more entries than
max_segments? I have not seen this during my experiments, but then i
likely have not hit every case of a possible request layout.
