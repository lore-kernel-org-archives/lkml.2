it's not related to the recursive merge. I forgot the detail of the
workload why we add INSERT_SORT_MERGE, it's added several months ago
anyway.
Obviously we shouldn't do complex things inside the merge window. I just
didn't agree to disable INSERT_SORT_MERGE, which will bring performance
regression for sure. Can we just change CFQ like your first path?
