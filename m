Marek Belisko <marek.belisko@gmail.com> reports that recent attempts

An examination of a network trace captured during the failure shows
that the mount is actually succeeding, but that the client is not
seeing READ replies larger than 16KB.

Last fall we removed the ad hoc mount option parser in fs/nfs/nfsroot.c
in favor of using the main parser in fs/nfs/super.c (see commit
56463e50 "NFS: Use super.c for NFSROOT mount option parsing").  That
commit changed the default NFSROOT mount options to be the same as
those employed by user space mounts.  As it turns out, that change is
not tolerated by many embedded systems.

Subsequently, commit 53d47375 introduced a clean way to specify
default mount options for NFSROOT, so we can restore the traditional
defaults for NFSROOT easily now:

   vers=2,udp,rsize=4096,wsize=4096

This should revert the changed default NFSROOT mount options
introduced with commit 56463e50.

Hi-

Please test this, as I no longer have an NFSROOT rig here.

Can some responsible maintainer type see that this gets into
linux-next quickly for broader testing?
