I know;  as far as I know there's still 96 bits of free space in the group
descriptor, which could be used to crc32 all three bitmaps.  But then that
leaves the descriptors with no room for further expansion, unless we decide to
expand them sort of like what was done for inodes.  Do we have a strategy for
handling continued expansion of metadata objects in ext4?

Besides "don't" or "use btrfs"? :)
