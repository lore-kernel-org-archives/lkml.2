Well, when you put things like

"NOT FOR COMMIT USE; TESTING ONLY; NO WARRANTY; DANGER!"

and

"I constructed this patch for my friend to test, completely blind.
I haven't heard back from him at all yet, but I thought that the wider
community might find it useful for testing as well. I think it _should_
work, just need to figure out what the correct chip variant is."

On the patch it tends to make maintainers exercise extreme caution.
Thus comments from others (preferably successful test reports) or acks
from Marvell or Vertex would be very helpful.
