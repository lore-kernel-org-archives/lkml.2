The discussion leading up to the resurrection of SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA
was pretty much about that point.  The conclusion based on the Sun
documentation and common sense was that SEEK_DATA may only consider
unwritten extents as hole if the filesystem has a way to distinguish
plain unwritten extents and those that have been dirtied.  Else it
should be considered data.

Testing for making sure dirty preallocated areas aren't wrongly
reported sounds relatively easy, the rest falls into implementation
details, which imho is fine.  Not reporting preallocated extents
as holes just is a quality of implementation issue and not a bug.
