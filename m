Well, I don't mind against something more generic than the check in
execve(), however, the usefulness of the check in mmap() is unclear to
me.  You want to make more programs fail after setuid(), but does mmap
stops really many programs?  Do you know any program doing mmap/dlopen
after setuid() call?  What if the program will not do any mmap/dlopen
and e.g. start to handle network connections or do some computations?
I suppose the latter case is much more often than mmap/dlopen.

(Also, reading significant amount of data could be gained via read()
without any mmap.)

More generic place is all resource allocation syscalls, but it start to
be too complex for this sort of things IMO.


Meanwhile, the patch with the cleared PF on successful fork/exec is as
follows:

-------------------------------------------
From: Vasiliy Kulikov <segoon@openwall.com>
Subject: [patch v2] move RLIMIT_NPROC check from set_user() to do_execve_common()

The patch http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/13/226 introduced an RLIMIT_NPROC
check in set_user() to check for NPROC exceeding via setuid() and
similar functions.  Before the check there was a possibility to greatly
exceed the allowed number of processes by an unprivileged user if the
program relied on rlimit only.  But the check created new security
threat: many poorly written programs simply don't check setuid() return
code and believe it cannot fail if executed with root privileges.  So,
the check is removed in this patch because of too often privilege
escalations related to buggy programs.

The NPROC can still be enforced in the common code flow of daemons
spawning user processes.  Most of daemons do fork()+setuid()+execve().
The check introduced in execve() (1) enforces the same limit as in
setuid() and (2) doesn't create similar security issues.

Neil Brown suggested to track what specific process has exceeded the
limit by setting PF_NPROC_EXCEEDED process flag.  With the change only
this process would fail on execve(), and other processes' execve()
behaviour is not changed.

Solar Designer suggested to re-check whether NPROC limit is still
exceeded at the moment of execve().  If the process was sleeping for
days between set*uid() and execve(), and the NPROC counter step down
under the limit, the defered execve() failure because NPROC limit was
exceeded days ago would be unexpected.  If the limit is not exceeded
anymore, we clear the flag on both execve() and fork().

Similar check was introduced in -ow patches (without the process flag).
