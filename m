I updated to the latest on LSI's site today before emailing. It changes the 
behavior slightly. With the older firmware, it would not print any of the 
initial reset messages, but would once udev decides to start killing modprobe. 
With the new firmware, I get a:

ADP_RESET_GEN2: HostDiag=a0

followed by a bunch of:

RESET_GEN2: retry=%x, hostdiag=a4

Now I'm not sure the hostdiag should be different between the two. if this aN 
identifier is similar to the aN identifiers in the MegaCli tool, then it would 
mean its trying to reset a device that doesn't exist? I only have a single 
M1015 card installed.

It boots and runs fine without the sas card installed. I haven't run any heavy 
load tests, but it seems ok.

Nope. This is the furthest I've gotten it to get with this card installed. The 
old system would fail to boot into grub properly, let alone linux. These cards 
seem to be /very/ picky about what motherboard you install them in.
