That would mean that if LIO merged in .37:

1. It would be merged _without_ STGT ABI compatibility, i.e. one of the 
requirements for a new SCSI target infrastructure merge is violated.

2. It would _not_ be a drop in replacement for STGT, because STGT's 
drivers/scsi/scsi_tgt_*.c code would stay in the kernel. Those would 
effectively mean that another requirement for a new SCSI target 
infrastructure merge would be violated: there would be 2 SCSI target 
infrastructures in the kernel and any STGT in-kernel driver (for 
instance, built as an outside module) would continue working. My 
understanding of "drop in replacement" is "one out, another in at once".

Please tell me where I'm wrong? I would appreciate if you be precise and 
answer the above 2 my concerns. There is no point to again repeat what 
you have already written without adding any new information.

My look is completely impartial. With all my respect, I'm just quite 
ahead of you and can see what you are unable (or don't want?) to see. I 
did what you are currently doing almost 4 years ago. I have already 
written all the necessary code and addressed all _rose on practice_ 
concerns. But all my attempts to explain my view are just blindly 
ignored without any considerations, so I have no idea how more I can 
explain it.

Thanks,
