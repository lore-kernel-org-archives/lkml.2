Ooh, BTW, there was a bug where workqueue code created a false
dependency between two work items.  Workqueue currently considers two
work items to be the same if they're on the same address and won't
execute them concurrently - ie. it makes a work item which is queued
again while being executed wait for the previous execution to
complete.

If a work function frees the work item, and then waits for an event
which should be performed by another work item and *that* work item
recycles the freed work item, it can create a false dependency loop.
There really is no reliable way to detect this short of verifying
every memory free.  A patch is queued to make such occurrences less
likely (work functions should also match for two work items considered
the same), but if you're seeing this, the best thing to do is freeing
the work item at the end of the work function.

Thanks.
