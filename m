Heh, well having this problem is usually a reason the driver disallows
interrupt sharing.

Like I said, I don't see a reason why installing the handler would
trigger the interrupt, so lets try just moving the lock first.  I'd only
need the install disabled if I weren't disabling interrupts during
setup, which would be nice, but not necessary since this driver is coded
to do that already.
