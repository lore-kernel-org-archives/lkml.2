[CCing kay]

Kay does not like the idea of doing something along this line in udev.
He thinks that kernel changes over a period of time making udev rules
stale and hence it should be done in kernel. :-) I think he has had
some not so good experiences in the past.

Though personally I think that anything which is not set in stone should
go to udev. It atleast allows for easy change if user does not like the
setting. (disable the rule, modify the rule etc). And then rules evolve
as things change in kernel.

Anyway, this point can be detabted later once we figure out what's the
set of atrributes to look at.

I am wondering what will happen to request based multipath targets in
this scheme. There will have to be I guess additional rules to look for
underlying paths and then change the io scheduler accordingly.

CCing linux-scsi, if scsi guys have some ideas on what can we look at to 
determine what scheduler to use.

Thanks
