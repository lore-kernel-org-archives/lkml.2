The above looks good.

Not sure if that is necessary since it seems that we triggered kswapd
before? Why not continue to do it? Once kswapd has enough higher order
pages kswapd should no longer be triggered right?

Its cheaper for reclaim path true but more expensive in terms of SLUBs
management costs of the data and it also increases the memory wasted. A
higher order means denser packing of objects less page management
overhead. Fallback is not for free. Reasonable effort should be made to
allocate the page order requested.

Looks good too.

Overall, it looks like the compaction logic and the modifications to
reclaim introduced recently with the intend to increase the amount of
physically contiguous memory is not working as expected.

SLUBs chance of getting higher order pages should be *increasing* as a
result of these changes. The above looks like the chances are decreasing
now.

This is a matter of future concern. The metadata management overhead
in the kernel is continually increasing since memory sizes keep growing
and we typically manage memory in 4k chunks. Through large allocation
sizes we can reduce that management overhead but we can only do this if we
have an effective way of defragmenting memory to get longer contiguous
chunks that can be managed to a single page struct.

Please make sure that compaction and related measures really work properly.

The patches suggest that the recent modifications are not improving the
situation.
