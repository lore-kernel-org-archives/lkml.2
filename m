To avoid the first time trim operation.
Every boot time. run the fitrim then it trims all block groups again.
but it's already done at previous time. so don't need to trim it
again.
Doesn't make sense? I think it's not designed behavior.

In your patch at http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/102918/

with the patch:
[root@boyu-tm linux-2.6]# time ./ftrim /mnt/ext4/a
real	0m5.625s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m1.269s
[root@boyu-tm linux-2.6]# time ./ftrim /mnt/ext4/a
real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.001s
[root@boyu-tm linux-2.6]# time ./ftrim /mnt/ext4/a
real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.001s

After reboot. it maybe become below

[root@boyu-tm linux-2.6]# time ./ftrim /mnt/ext4/a
real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.001s
[root@boyu-tm linux-2.6]# time ./ftrim /mnt/ext4/a
real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.001s
[root@boyu-tm linux-2.6]# time ./ftrim /mnt/ext4/a
real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.001s
