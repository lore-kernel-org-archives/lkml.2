Looking at the ext4_page_mkwrite, it does this:

lock the page
check for holes
unlock the page
if (no_holes)
	return;

write_begin/write_end
return

So, to have page_mkwrite work, you need to wait for writeback with the
page locked in both the no holes case and after the
write_begin/write_end.  write_begin will dirty the page, so someone can
wander in and start the IO while we are still in page_mkwrite.

This is untested and uncompiled, but it should
do the trick.

Jan, did you get rid of all the buffer head based writeback for
data=ordered in ext4?  That's my only other idea, that someone is doing
writeback directly without taking the page lock.
