Hi,

Thanks for taking the time to evaluate c/r. You may want to also
try the latest, which is (as of now) ckpt-v20-rc2.

In the future, please CC the containers mailing list for issues
related to c/r, at "containers@lists.linux-foundation.org".

If you take an external checkpoint, then you need to match it
with an external restart, as opposed to self_restart.

Otherwise, restarting with self_restart from a checkpoint that is
not a self-checkpoint can yield unexpected results.

Since you don't mention in your post, I don't know if you are using
the tools from user-cr. If not, then you should use 'checkpoint' and
'restart' tools from there. It is available from:
	git://git.ncl.cs.columbia.edu/pub/git/user-cr.git
(use the same branch as the one you used to linux-cr).

Once you have the tools compiled, and you checkpoint with the
'checkpoint' utility from there, you can restart with:
	restart -v < ckpt.image
