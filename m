I am pretty sure that they handled all of these cases.  I also had some tests which exercised the modified path based system calls and at least, at one point in time, they would run without returning ESTALE to the user level.

Yes, your original set was very comprehensive, AFAICT. I'm not sure if
it'll apply to mainline well at this point, but I was definitely using
it as a guideline for what to do here.

The cover letter for the patchset that you sent out a few years ago had
a testcase in it. I was planning to use that to test once I start
broading this to other syscalls:
