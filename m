Hello, Nao.

Sorry but I still don't get it.  If you can extract the log, the
information is there and w/ remote logging (be it via serial or
network), the information always has to be there.  Are you talking
about the case where somehow only the video console somehow succeeds
to print out oops?  I don't think that's a common case as serial (also
on IPMI) tends to be pretty robust, often more robust than vide
output, and even when such case occurs, the only thing you want is
mapping kernel device name to more recognizable information, which
isn't difficult at all.  If you wanna do it in a really simple manner,
just save udisks --dump output after boot and each hotplug event and
write a simple script to search it.

Eh?  What difference does that make?  Just make the target machines
send up-to-date disk config info to the log server.

Yes, I do understand what it's doing and can see there can be cases it
can be somewhat useful but I still think it's too adhoc an approach
which doesn't really justify itself.  It just does too little to solve
the actual problem and even that 'little' part isn't very trivial - it
adds whole lot of policy decisions to make and I'm pretty sure it will
cause good amount of havoc w/ all the system tools which currently
don't expect block device names to change to some admin determined
free format string on the fly.

Thanks.
