"Hm" might be right.  writes have a 'struct file', but mkdir and rename etc
just get an inode.
So to be able to notify based on vfsmnt, mkdirat - for examine - would need
to pass the path to vfs_mkdir rather than path.dentry->d_inode, and vfs_mkdir
would have to pass that path to fsnotify_mkdir.  So more intrusive that I
imagined, but still quite do-able.... if it were thought to be useful.
