Hi Steve,

Thanks for the walk-through, but still some doubts...

No, you're right, it should not really matter, but here in the
worst case you put the driver on sleep for almost 22 seconds,
that is a huge difference compared to the original
implementation.

Premising that I don't know the device, therefore I could be
totally wrong, if you don't expect things to wait so long, why not
to decrease the MAX_DRIVER_CMD_RETRIES and sleep increasingly (as
you did) but for shorter period?
