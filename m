OK, just to make sure I understand you...  You are asking for two additional
RCU API members:

1.	rcu_access_pointer() or some such that includes ACCESS_ONCE(),
	but not smp_read_barrier_depends(), which may be used when
	we are simply examining the value of the RCU-protected pointer
	(as in the NFS case).  It could also be used when the
	appropriate update-side lock is held, but for that we have:

2.	rcu_dereference_protected() or some such that includes neither
	ACCESS_ONCE() nor smp_read_barrier_depends(), and that may
	only be used if updates are prevented, for example, by holding
	the appropriate update-side lock.

Does this fit?

							Thanx, Paul
