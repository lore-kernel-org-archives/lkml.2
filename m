I do this stuff on modest hardware:  ata_piix.
There is NO QUEUE TO FLUSH.

So one might expect TRIM to operate at the same speed as ordinary WRITEs.
But it doesn't.  When I measured this in detail (and things have not changed
much since then), we were talking 10s of milliseconds to 100s of milliseconds
per TRIM command.

The only possible explanation for that would be waiting on flash erase commands.
