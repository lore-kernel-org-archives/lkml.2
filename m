Since nobody objected, Greg, could you consider to ACK SCST SYSFS
management interface in /sys/kernel/scst_tgt/, please? Please find the
SCST SYSFS ABI documentation file you requested below.

We are also preparing a new patch to free our objects in kobjects.release()
without explicit x_initialized flags as you requested.

Thank you for your effort,
Vlad
