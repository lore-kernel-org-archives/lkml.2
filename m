The race in question occurs when you manage to check mtime between two
file data updates, with all three operations occurring within a clock
tick.

No idea if that's feasible in hundreds of nanoseconds.

I'm also not sure how to judge the access latency.  Certainly a
microsecond is a lot compared to just reading a cached mtime value.

Will we ever see them go backwards?  (So if I know I wrote to file B
after writing to file A, is there ever a case where I could end up with
an earlier mtime on B than A?)

--b.
