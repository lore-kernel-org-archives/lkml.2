Erm, no, I was thinking of something much more simple.  Right at the
moment if (retryable_command) is if (scmnd->cmnd[0] != ATA_16)

Although I'm sure there are other commands that are not retryable ... I
don't really know since I'm not sure what else your hypervisor will
choke on.  It might be simpler to have a list of known good retryable
commands (READ_ WRITE_ GET_CAPACITY_ INQUIRY etc. i.e. the commands sd
normally uses) and assume anything outside that range isn't retryable
but someone who knows what's going on in the hypervisor needs to decide
this.

The point is that you don't pre-filter.  You send the command and then
try and work out from the generic error and the type of command you sent
what happened.  That way, if the hypervisor ever works properly (or
simply passes commands through to real devices) it will "just work"
rather than failing because of the pre-filter.

We should only use the pre-filter if the effects of the command are
fatal (like we have to a lot in USB because the firmware crashes and
hangs).
