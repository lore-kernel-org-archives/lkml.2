I see the issue too with an ARMv5 based DM355 board with the just released
v2.6.37 tag (nfs client). I too see the issue when using bash tab completion.

Here are some logs:

fileid changed fsid 0:c: expected fileid 0x2db61d, got 0x2dad20

fileid changed fsid 0:c: expected fileid 0x100000000000, got 0x7070000000000000

I am using Fedora 8 (2.6.25 kernel) on the server side. I will try the latest
Ubuntu release on the server side and test.

Thanks,
Sekhar
