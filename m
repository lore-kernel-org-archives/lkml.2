OK, sorry, that's not quite fair; we should add details about experience
with alternative approaches in nfsd and samba (mapping between ACL
models, adding "posix" acl support to the protocols, making the protocol
daemon store and enforce the ACL instead of the filesystem).  And
probably cc: samba-technical on that one message so they can confirm or
deny any of that.
