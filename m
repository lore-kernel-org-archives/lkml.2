I don't have any opinion on the above, but I don't see why sysfs can't be
used for configuration as well as its other roles. It seems to me wasteful
to require configfs to be used in order to change configuration when
sysfs works fine for this.

Here are a couple of existing examples where sysfs is used in a role that
would seem similar to SCST's usage:

1) scsi_transport_fc already has an sysfs file, fc_host/vport_create, which
can be written to create new fc_host and scsi_host instances.

2) fcoe.ko uses a write to the sysfs file /sys/module/fcoe/parameters/create
to start the protocol on a particular ethernet interface.  There's another
file for destroy.

I'll bet there are other examples in other subsystems, and I don't think
there is anything wrong with the above usages of sysfs.

I agree with Vladislav's point that configfs doesn't work instead of sysfs
because configs doesn't make it easy for the kernel side to create nodes for
dynamic information like connected initiators and statistics.
So, if the above examples are considered a misuse of sysfs,
SCST would need to use both sysfs and configfs.  It would use configfs to
do configuration, and sysfs to display and access the dynamic information
like connected initiators.  That seems a minor role for configfs,
which is easily handled in sysfs as SCST currently does.

Just my two cents.
