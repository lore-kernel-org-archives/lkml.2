If you are getting controller resets during driver load, you must not
be getting interrupts or firmware is not responding to the inquiry
roll-call.  Make sure you have the latest firmware.

The code at the end of megasas_adp_reset_gen2() just looks for
DIAG_RESET_ADAPTER flag to clear on the host diag register when
issuing a controller reset... that should happen almost immediately
unless there is a hardware or firmware issue.

Are you sure your 'new' motherboard is actually good ?

Can you move your megaraid 9240-8i into a 'known working' system and re-test ?
