*nod*

Both mmap and write paths need to be block on
wait_for_page_writeback(page) once they have a locked page ready for
modification. btrfs does this in btrfs_page_mkwrite() and
prepare_pages(), so adding similar calls into block_page_mkwrite()
and grab_cache_page_write_begin() would probably fix the problem for
the other major filesystems....

IMO blocking is generally preferable in high throughput threaded
workloads as there is always another thread that can do useful work
while we wait for IO to complete. Most use cases for DIF center
around high throughput environments....
