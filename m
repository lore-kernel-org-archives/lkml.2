Surely if a userspace tool and shell-script can accomplish this,
totally lacking real filesystem knowledge, then we should be able
to approximate it in kernel space?

This is FITRIM we're talking about, not the on-the-fly automatic TRIM.

FITRIM could perhaps use a similar approach to what wiper.sh does:
reserve a large number of free blocks, and issue coalesced TRIM(s) on them.

The difference being, it could walk through the filesystem,
trimming in sections, rather than trying to reserve/trim the entire
freespace all in one go.

Over-thinking it???
