Can we please start with profiling the workload causing trouble, see why
ext4 takes such a hit, and see if anything can be done there to fix
it surgically, rather than just throwing this big hammer at it?

In my (admittedly quick, hacky) test, xfs suffed about a 1% perf degradation,
ext4 about 8%.  Until we at least know why ext4 is so much worse, I'll
signal a strong NAK for this change, for whatever may or may not be worth.  :)
