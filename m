That sounds like it would be reasonable...

It would be important not to read too much into the number though.  i.e.
don't think of it as "RAID1" but keep a much more abstract idea, else you
could run into trouble.

A (near) future addition to md is keeping track of 'bad blocks' so we can
fail more gracefully as devices start to fail.
So a read request to a RAID1 might not be served by just one device, but
might be served by one device for some parts, and another device for other
parts, so as to avoid one or more 'bad blocks'.

I think I could still provide a reasonably consistent mapping from 'arbitrary
number' to 'set of devices', but it may not be what you expect.  And the
number '1' may well correspond to different devices for different bi_sector
offsets.

i.e. the abstraction must allow the low level implementation substantial
freedom to choosing how to implement each request.

But yes - I don't see why we couldn't report which strategy was used with the
implication that using that same strategy at the same offset with the same
size would be expected to produce the same result.
