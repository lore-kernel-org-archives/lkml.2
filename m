I too would much prefer that gcc volatile worked more sanely.

But several people, including me, pushed on that and consistently got back
"the standard doesn't say we have to do that".

So I got together with the standards people and now there is something
(memory_order_relaxed atomics) that is specified to work the way we want
it to.  Of course, it will likely be quite some time before it appears
in usable form in gcc, but probably quite a bit less time than we have
been pushing on the gcc folks about volatile.

Only SMP-atomic.

I must admit that the non-x86 per-CPU atomics are, ummm, "interesting".
