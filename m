Well, it's not SUSE v Red Hat, it's upstream v Enterprise ... and it's
partly my job to explain why upstream does correct fixes not enterprise
workarounds (whether the enterprise is RHEL or SLES).  But I agree it's
becoming a pointless distraction.

Right, so thanks for that.

Most of our problem is tied up in the fact that we need to allocate in
the prepare path, but we don't have a corresponding clear unprepare path
to do the deallocation in.  Introducing that into block might sort out
this tangle better ... error handling on the backend is very convoluted
and we can't really free the page until after it's complete (and the
->done function doesn't mark completion of error handling terms).  I
think the bones of a solution to this might be that
scsi_unprep_request() needs to call into block (instead of setting the
flags itself), say blk_unprep_request.  Block also needs to call
blk_unprep_request based on the REQ_DONTPREP status in its completion
path.  This would then give us a hook to hang the deallocation correctly
on.
