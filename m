I don't see that explicitly mentioned, but it doesn't matter much
anyway.

In the mac80211 case, messages are warnings/hints to the user, we just
don't want them to flood the logs too much. I'd rather have that kind of
change (limit cookie per callsite) in the rate limiting semantics than
the change in the when it gets printed at all.

I simply feel that obscuring the debugging even further wouldn't be a
good thing to do right now. I'd rather have somebody convert all of it
to the new debugging infrastructure but that seems a lot more effort
than changing these back to something that isn't impacted by dynamic
printk.
