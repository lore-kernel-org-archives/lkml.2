I agree that there might devices which crash on this response.

This is OK to add WCE variable, but again this "on the fly" is
confusing. I expect this to be initialized the moment I plug-in the
USB. If the user has to take this decision - then again there has to
be a supporting fact so as to change the "cache type" from sysfs.
Again, the point would be how to get this if the device do not respond
correctly. sd_store_cache_type() - is this main code point which needs
to be thoroughly checked for this? especially the scsi_mode_select()?
Please correct me if I am wrong.
