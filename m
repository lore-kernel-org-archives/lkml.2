FWIW, wrapping wait_event_killable in freezer_do_not_count/freezer_count
seems to work. The machine suspends consistently with it. It sounds
like Rafael has concerns about this scheme however, so I'll let you

Once you tell me the right scheme to use, I'll be happy to fix up cifs
and nfs to use it.

Thanks,
