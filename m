Tejun,

Mikulas doesn't speak for Alasdair or the rest of the DM developers.  He
speaks for himself.  He, like me, is a member of the team that helps
maintain DM.  But Alasdair is the upstream DM maintainer.

Please don't latch on to Mikulas' disruptive stone-walling.  As I shared
in my previous reply: your FLUSH+FUA contributions to DM are very much
appreciated!  Kiyoshi, Jun'ichi and myself have all worked with you
effectively and so far the end result DM conversion has proven quite
stable and correct.  Wider testing via linux-next is an important next
step.

Jens, please don't drop the DM FLUSH+FUA conversion patches from your
'for-next' branch.  Mikulas has yet to offer a single substantive
criticism of the code in question.

Alasdair, please advise ASAP.

Thanks,
Mike
