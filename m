Hi,

I was the original reporter of the Bugzilla issue, just didn't know
about this thread until recently.  Anyway, I'm running 3.2-rc1 now,
which contains the alternative fix, and I can confirm that it indeed
works: hibernation does not deadlock on my XFS rooted system anymore
during memory preallocation.  Thanks everybody for his or her work on
the issue!

To add something still, preallocation now ends with a couple of seconds
of heavy disk activity, but with several seconds of total inactivity
beforehand.  Is this warranted by some CPU intensive task at that stage?

Feri.
