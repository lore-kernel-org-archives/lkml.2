You're right, at this point in time writepage and page_mkwrite in ext4 both
behave as you describe.  I began backing out parts of my patches to
bio-integrity.c and discovered that with the current kernel (2.6.39-rc5) the
only part that seems useful is the set_memory_ro/rw pair from that old
debugging patch.  Unfortunately, those two functions only seem to exist on x86;
I suppose I could port them to others.  If that's even a sane idea.
