Both have subtleties ... see below.

A single flush won't quite work.  The target is a parent of the device,
both of which release methods have execute_in_process_context()
requirements.  What can happen here is that the last put of the device
will release the target (from the function).  If both are moved to
workqueues, a single flush could cause the execution of the device work,
which then queues up target work (and makes it still pending).  A double
flush will solve this (because I think our nesting level doesn't go
beyond 2) but it's a bit ugly ...

execute_in_process_context() doesn't have this problem because the first
call automatically executes the second inline (because it now has
context).
