Sounds like a real problem. I would suggest a few remedies.
1. Make a filesystem persistent parameter that says noatime/relatime/atime
   So the default if not specified on mount is taken as a property of
   the FS (mkfs can set it)
2. The snapshot program should check and complain if it is on, and recommend
   an off. Since the problem only starts with a snapshot.
3. If space availability drops under some threshold, disable atime. As you said
   this is catastrophic in this case. So user can always search and delete files.
   In fact if the IO was only because of atime, it should be a soft error, warned,
   and ignored.

But perhaps the true solution is to put atime on a side table, so only the atime
info gets COW and not the all MetaData

Just my $0.017
