Um, is this a completely modified 2.6.35-rc6 kernel?  The reason why I
ask is there is no BUG_ON at line fs/ext4/mballoc.c:2993 for that
kernel version.

There are two BUG_ON statements nearby, but given the line number
doesn't match up with either one, it's hard to say for sure which one
triggered it.  What were the kernel messages right before the BUG_ON?
was there a "start NNNNN size NNN, fe_logical NNNN" (where NNNN is
some number) right before the "cut here" message?

Have you tried forcing an fsck run on the file system to make sure
it's not caused by a file-system corruption?

And have you tried using a standard released gcc so we can determine
for sure whether this is a potential kernel bug, file system
corruption issue, or gcc issue?
