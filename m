In reviewing the current code paths wasn't the serial_number also used to
avoid calling __scsi_try_to_abort_cmd for START_UNIT case also.

If we skip __scsi_try_to_abort_cmd when REQ_ATOM_COMPLETE is set it would
be correct for the scsi_decide_disposition cases but it would appear this
would stop __scsi_try_to_abort_cmd from being called in the time out
case as REQ_ATOM_COMPLETE is set prior to calling blk_rq_timed_out.

1.) Request timed out path to scsi_eh_scmd_add.

blk_rq_timed_out_timer
	...
	if (blk_mark_rq_complete(rq))
		continue;
	blk_rq_timed_out
		q->rq_timed_out_fn "scsi_times_out"
			scsi_times_out
				scsi_eh_scmd_add

2.) Request completion path to scsi_eh_scmd_add based on
scsi_decide_disposition disposition set to FAILED (actually
scsi_eh_scmd_add called from the default case with the disposition of
FAILED appearing to be the only disposition returned that would hit this
case vs. the other three handled cases). This should not be a common path
outside of handling allow_restart.

blk_complete_request
	...
	if (!blk_mark_rq_complete(req))
		__blk_complete_request
			...
			raise_softirq_irqoff(BLOCK_SOFTIRQ);
blk_done_softirq
	rq->q->softirq_done_fn "scsi_softirq_done"
		scsi_softirq_done
			scsi_eh_scmd_add

3.) Call path to scsi_try_to_abort_cmd.
scsi_error_handler
	scsi_unjam_host
		scsi_eh_abort_cmds
			scsi_try_to_abort_cmd
