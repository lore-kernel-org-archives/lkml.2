At the level of SCSI commands, tape device state assumptions
made by the st driver could be compromised by SCSI commands
sent by the sg driver. However the BKL was never meant
to address that concern.

 From the comment in st_open() [st.c] it would be using
nonseekable_open() as well but there are apps out there
that do lseek()s on its file descriptors. Not sure
how long nonseekable_open() has been in the sg driver
but no-one has complained to me about it.

The BKL is not used to protect any of the internal
objects within the sg driver. From memory it was added
in some large code sweep through, not unlike what you
are proposing now.

So I would not be concerned about any kernel locking
interactions between the sg and st drivers. I have
added Kai Makisara (st maintainer) to the cc list.
