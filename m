No, very much the contrary, despite the condescending
attempt at "explanation".

    config EXT4_USE_FOR_EXT23
        bool "Use ext4 for ext2/ext3 file systems"
        depends on EXT4_FS
        depends on EXT3_FS=n || EXT2_FS=n
        default y
        help
          Allow the ext4 file system driver code to be used for ext2 or
          ext3 file system mounts.  This allows users to reduce their
          compiled kernel size by using one file system driver for
          ext2, ext3, and ext4 file systems.

So the option is supposed to allow ext4 code to be used
to access ext2 and ext3 filesystems, saving some space
in the binary kernel.  That much is obvious.

But far far less obvious is why the kernel reports
having mounted my ext4 filesystem as "ext2",
and what exactly it means by that.

And I've been a kernel developer as long as you have, Ted,
so just imagine the confusion this might be causing lots
of other less experienced people.

Thanks.
