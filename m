OK. So,the new behaviour in 2.6.37 is that we're writing to a series of
pages via the usual kmap_atomic()/kunmap_atomic() and kmap()/kunmap()
interfaces, but we can end up reading them via a virtual address range
that gets set up via vm_map_ram() (that range gets set up before the
write occurs).

Do we perhaps need an invalidate_kernel_vmap_range() before we can read
the data on ARM in this kind of scenario?
