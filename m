shost->shost_dev should inherit the numa node from the pci bus to which
it is attached.  So long as that works, there should be no concern over
which numa node the probe code is running on.

Yes, good point.

That's an interesting configuration.  I wonder what the numa_node sysfs
file contains for such systems--do you know?  I'm not sure how we could
allow this to be user-controlled at probe time.  Did you have a specific
mechanism in mind?  Module parameters?  Something else?

Thanks for your input, Bart.

Cheers,
Jeff
