This currently happens with lzo as well, right?

* mount without any compression
* remount -o compress=lzo
* write data
* umount
* => filesystem has lzo data without incompat bit set

This is clear that the incompatibility should be set, because the user
wants it so and the lz4 patches should do the same. I see that the hc
incompatibility does not though, that has to be fixed.

Let's say it returns EINVAL upon remount, then I need to do umount/mount
with the desired option. Remount is usually not done by accident, so
similar to the defrag, I'd expect the operation to succeed, but I as a
user may not know that it brings a backward incompatibility. Getting rid
of an incompat is not straightfoward at all, so I understand the
caution.

My preference is to let remount succeed and set the incompat bit,
possibly with a KERN_INFO message to syslog in case the bit is yet
unseen by the volume.
