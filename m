SCST objects are generally 1:1 mapping of SCSI Architecture Model (SAM)
objects. Is SAM insane and should have been designed with kobjects in
mind? ;)

"To get stuff under /sys/..." is exactly for what SCST needs kobjects.
SCST objects are user interface agnostic and can be equally well exposed
to user space via SYSFS, PROCFS, or anything else, like CONFIGFS or
custom IOCTLs.

Sorry, but what is incorrect in the working implementation without any
bugs doing its job in the simplest, smallest and clearest way?

If those objects remade to free themselves in the kobjects release(),
what value would it add to them? Would the implementation be simpler,
smaller or clearer? Not, I believe, new implementation would be only
bigger and less clear. So, what's the point to do it to make the code worse?

Hmm, we never put any stuff into the device tree. Why do you think we
do? None of SCST objects has any relation to any hardware device, hence
there's no need to touch the device tree.
