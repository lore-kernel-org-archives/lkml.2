Define "won't work". i.e. what's the test case?  I just created a
sparse file and checked it, and it reported all the extents in it:

# xfs_bmap -vp testfile 
testfile:

FWIW, filefrag seems busted - the file has 8 extents, not 9.

For a more fragmented sparse file (25,000 extents):

# for i in `seq 1 2 50000`; do dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile bs=4k count=1 seek=$i; done
....
# xfs_bmap -vp testfile | grep -v hole | wc -l
25002
# filefrag -v testfile |tail -1
testfile: 25001 extents found

So taking away the 2 header lines from xfs_bmap output we have 25000
extents, and filefrag has over-counted by one again. However, we are
we are definitely finding all the extents through fiemap...

Right, it's not broken, we simply return less than fi_extent_mex
extents when there are holes. I don't see that as a problem as
applications have to handle that case anyway, and....

That's rather dangerous, I think. It relies on other code to catch
the buffer overrun that this sets up for fragmented, non-sparse
files. Personally I'd much prefer to return fewer extents for sparse
files than to add a landmine like this into the kernel code....

Cheers,

Dave.
