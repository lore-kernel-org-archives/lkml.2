Ah, but it sounds like it would be better to fix up netoops to handle
your needs.

Understood, I'm sure that a change to allow this to the existing netoops
code would be appreciated by many.

I bet the whole world would benefit by having the oops messages in a
more "structured" manner.  We have done changes in the past to provide
this type of thing in a "more parsable" manner, to help stuff like
kerneloops.org.  I'm sure that adding this type of information to the
main oops core/messages would be a good overall goal, instead of only
having it available to only this one option/user, right?

Yes, I agree netconsole would be good to get this type of change.

I thought we had something like "only show the first oops" somewhere in
the kernel, perhaps I'm just imagining things...

If I am, adding this for all oopses would also be good.

I think you have just convinced me that you should add this type of
functionality for all oops messages even more, instead of only doing it
for your one type of oops transport :)

As for the user/kernel interface, perhaps exporting the data in a text
format that is "tagged" would be best?  Then the whole world can parse
it easily.
