I know you weren't asking for design suggestions, but somehow I just couldn't
help myself :-)

The (or "a") problem with {d,i,fa}notify is that it makes a core assumption
that is flawed.  i.e. that a file is in some directory.  It might be nice if
that were a reliable fact but thanks to our founding fathers, it is not.
If a file only ever had one name - never more nor less - and could not have
that name changed while it were open, then quite a lot of things would be a
lot easier.  And probably a lot of things would be a lot harder.  But we don't
live in that world (others do - I think you know where it is).

So we must drop this assumption.

Getting notification on an fd when the opened file changes makes perfect
sense.  Some /proc and /sys files already provide this functionality and we
can expect that more will.  Adding that to regular filesystems may not be out
of the question.  This would be useful, but of limited use.  You could find
out when a given file changed - either an mtime-like change or a ctime-like
change.  By monitoring a directory you could find out when a name was added
or removed.  But to find out when "any file in a directory changes" you would
need to open and monitor every file, which is expensive.

The other ("another") problem is the lack of recursion.  You can find out
when a file in a directory changes, but not a file in a directory tree.  This
significantly reduces the value.   We really want to know about directory
trees.  However a "directory tree" - much like "all the files in a directory"
isn't really a very well defined concept - at least from the perspective of
providing notifications.  You cannot easily answer "is this file in that
tree?" or "which tree(s) is this file in?".

However there are well defined sets of files such that we could reliably
generate notifications if any file in the set were changed, or if a file were
added-to or remove-from the set.  We should be looking for these sorts of
sets and seeing which are useful.

e.g.
 - all files in a given filesystem.   Generating notification for any change
   in a given filesystem is a well defined task.  It might generate too much
   noise, but it would still have a place.

 - all files with a given uid (or gid).

 - all directories.  or all regular files

 - all setuid, setgid, or world-writable files

Each of these are strongly defined and we can map from file to set quite
easily.  We could obviously intersect the sets to, so I could get events when
any directory owned by me on a particular filesystem was changed.  It would
even be reasonable for the events to contain a newly opened fd from which I
can extract dev/inode info and possibly extract a path name.

However this still might not be fine-grained enough.  While a "directory
tree" is not really a well defined concept, it is in my mind.  e.g. it
seems reasonable to want to find out about all changes in $HOME/.config

I can see two approaches to this - though there might be others.  All of
them must in some way create a strong concept of a directory tree.

One is to use bind mounts. i.e. I effectively do
    mount --bind $HOME/.config $HOME/.config
and ask for events from the newly created vfsmnt.
This will not catch changes made through file descriptors that were opened
before I did the mount, or through hard links from some other directory
tree.  But for a particular use-case that might not be a problem.

The other requires support from the filesystem and so cannot be provided
universally.  It could possibly be imposed generically for filesystems that
support extended attributes .... but I feel dirty even suggesting that (Dobby
must now go and iron his hands!)

The filesystem could support the concept of a 'directory tree' much like
BTRFS allows subvolumes which a like independent filesystems within the one
big filesystem.  However for this purpose the 'directory tree' would be a
very light weight concept (it wouldn't need its own inode number space).

For example, each inode could store an extra number which is the inode number
of the root of its directory tree.  This would be inherited from parent
during create. Renaming or linking a file would fail if the target had a
different directory tree number.  (renaming a file with only one link might
succeed and change the directory tree number).   An empty directory could be
told to become a root somehow.

Then you would have a strong concept of a directory tree that could be used
for notifications.
Obviously this approach could not be used to solve any immediate problems.
But if new filesystems started supporting light-weight-directory-trees as a
well defined set of files, then in 5-10 years we might have a nice working
solution.


[of course then you need to layer any design you come up with on NFS ... but
that can probably be done in user-space with libraries and daemons].
