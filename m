This is a slightly prismatic view of history.  Firstly, LIO had wanted
into the kernel from way back in the PyX days and secondly, both code
bases (LIO and STGT) were impenetrably dense, had unacceptable /proc
interfaces plus a whole host of other nasties.  The decision to choose a
smaller (by an order of magnitutde) and more flexible implementation
that was in accord with all of the basic Linux necessities was a pretty
obvious one.

>From a performance point of view, (which is what the thread was about),
I'm OK with the assertion that there is a point where kernel/user
transitions dominate (by your own figures somewhere above 1GbE) which is
about the only reason I'm willing to consider an in-kernel solution.

I'm not sure where you read that.  I said, for performance, adding
in-kernel components to STGT would be OK ... keeping the user space
flexibility is still equally (or more) important.

Well, you and Nick have each kept repeating that about your respective
products ... it's the Bellman gambit.  From the performance point of
view, you're both about equal ... the Niche Features piece I've covered
elsewhere.

Fewer than half of the key players in the storage area are native
english speakers.
