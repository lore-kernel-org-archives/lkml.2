That would be possible. But again, I'm not sure if it is allowed for
one fs type to
differ from all the other filesystems in its default behavior.

That would definitely cause awareness for the problem and many people would
probably switch to noatime on mount.

It would be hard to determine a good threshold. This really depends on the way
snapshots are used.

This would definitely reduce the problem to a minimum. But it may be harder
to implement as it sounds. You would either have to keep 2 trees per subvolume
(one for the fs and one for atime) or share one tree for all subvols.
I don't think
2 trees per subvolume would be acceptable, but I'm not sure. A shared tree
would require to implement some kind of custom refcounting for the items, as
changes to one fs tree should not change atime of the other and thus create
new items on demand. It would probably also require snapshot origin tracking,
because on a freshly snapshotted subvolume, no atime entries would exist at
all and must be read from the parent/origin.
