I am not sure that this is entirely true. I am turning off my pc way to
more often than my phone. But it might be just me. Also some problem
might be mounting/umounting your external flash when you plug your
phone to the pc. So I can see than the mobile world probably requires
some solution. Not sure what it should be though.

Actually, with those chap flash cards I think that it might hurt its
life time, when you're doing discard way too often. But it really
depends on the wear-leveling algorithms it uses internally.

I do not like the idea very much. I would rather find some "smart" way
to overcome this problem, than adding more on disk format
incompatibilities.

We know that the performance problem starts to appear when the flash
does not have enough space to write new blocks without moving old
fragments of the erase block to the new position. It essentially means
that there is not enough "free" space which is the space which is free
and which has not been used since the last discard.

We know the size of the flash (from the user space), we also know the
number of kilobytes written to the file system in case of ext4
(/sys/fs/ext4/<device>/lifetime_write_kbytes) and if we can track the
change between fitrim calls we can more-or-less determine how much
"free" space is there on the flash available to efficiently write new
block. That said, I think that some user space heuristic can be applied
to determine when is the right time tu run fitrim again and it might
significantly help to solve the problem. Some experimenting has to be
done though, to get some numbers.

Also note that you do not have to run fitrim on the whole file system.
It can be run on the part of the file system as well. though the result
might differ between the file systems (some migh discard more blocks
than requested because it is efficient to do so, or really hard to do
differently).

The idea would require some more thoughts, but what is your opinion
about this approach ? Note that it can be done purely from user space.

Thanks!
