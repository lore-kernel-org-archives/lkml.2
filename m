I think that's correct and changing the priority of DM_ENDIO_REQUEUE
for REQ_FLUSH down to the lowest should be fine.
(I didn't know that FLUSH failure implies data loss possibility.)

But the patch is not enough, you have to change target drivers, too.
E.g. As for multipath, you need to change
     drivers/md/dm-mpath.c:do_end_io() to return error for REQ_FLUSH
     like the REQ_DISCARD support included in 2.6.36-rc1.


By the way, if these patch-set with the change above are included,
even one path failure for REQ_FLUSH on multipath configuration will
be reported to upper layer as error, although it's retried using
other paths currently.
Then, if an upper layer won't take correct recovery action for the error,
it would be seen as a regression for users. (e.g. Frequent EXT3-error
resulting in read-only mount on multipath configuration.)

Although I think the explicit error is fine rather than implicit data
corruption, please check upper layers carefully so that users won't see
such errors as much as possible.

Thanks,
Kiyoshi Ueda
