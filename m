Answered in your other e-mail. About the code complication, yes, it does
make the code more complicated. See below.

Honestly, I don't. For my particular use case, this would be always on,
and end of story. I was operating under the belief that being able to
say "Oh, I regret", and then turning it off would be beneficial, even at
the expense of the - self contained - complication.

For the general sanity of the interface, it is also a bit simpler to say
"if kmem is unlimited, x happens", which is a verifiable statement, than
to have a statement that is dependent on past history. But all of those
need of course, as you pointed out, to be traded off by the code complexity.

I am fine with either, I just need a clear sign from you guys so I don't
keep deimplementing and reimplementing this forever.
