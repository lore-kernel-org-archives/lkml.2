Patches are forthcoming that will first introduce overflow protection
to kref.  Once that's in place, I'll move a few refcount users from
atomic_t to kref as a reference for other subsystems; statistics-based
users (and others not requiring overflow protection) can continue
using atomic_t.

As Kees said, we just wanted to introduce the idea and get some
general feedback before beginning.  Thanks.
