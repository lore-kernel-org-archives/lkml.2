Indefinitely does make some sense (as Peter articulated in his original
set). It's possible you could race several times in a row, or a server
misconfiguration or something has happened and you have a transient
error that will eventually recover. His assertion was that any limit on
the number of retries is by definition wrong. For NFS, a fatal signal
ought to interrupt things as well, so retrying indefinitely has some
appeal there.

OTOH, we do have to contend with filesystems that might return ESTALE
persistently for other reasons and that might not respond to signals.
Miklos pointed out that some FUSE fs' do this in his review of Peter's
set.

As a purely defensive coding measure, limiting the number of retries to
something finite makes sense. If we're going to do that though, I'd
probably recommend that we set the number of retries be something
higher just so that this is more resilient in the face of multiple
races. Those other fs' might "spin" a bit in that case but it is an
error condition and IMO resiliency trumps performance -- at least in
this case.

Of course, if we're going to do this for all fs', then we probably
ought to try to handle ESTALEs that are encountered in the pathwalking
code in a similar way. That may mean changing do_path_lookup and
do_filp_open_* to reattempt several times on an ESTALE error.
