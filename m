  It was not lost but it got moved down into the filesystem. I forgot to
update the changelog. But after Dave's comments I think it can go back into
VFS. Just lockdep complained about deadlocks in my first naive approach -
that's why I started doing weird things with XFS locks after all.

  Anyway now I'm wiser regarding XFS locking and I also have better idea
how to achive proper lock ordering in VFS. Just we are finishing SLE11 SP2
so I didn't get to writing the patches last week... But I should get to it
maybe even today and if not then at least during this week ;)
