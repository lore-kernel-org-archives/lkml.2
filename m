FWIW, this option does not help (though it does change the
behavior).  I get hpsa complaining about bad tags returned
from the hardware, which is to say, this code from hpsa.c
fires:

	static inline int bad_tag(struct ctlr_info *h, u32 tag_index,
		u32 raw_tag)
	{
		if (unlikely(tag_index >= h->nr_cmds)) {
			dev_warn(&h->pdev->dev, "bad tag 0x%08x ignored.\n", raw_tag);
			return 1;
		}
		return 0;
	}

I had added "pcie_bus_safe" and "pci.pcie_bus_safe" to the command
line parameters.  (Was hard to tell how it was supposed to be used
as there is nothing in Documentation directory that mentions 
pcie_bus_safe.)
