It does not get it right, because of the situation I described
above. Background writeout can come in first, and clear the inode
dirty bits, and call your ->write_inode for async writeout.

That means you skip doing the exofs_put_io_state(), and (I presume)
this means you aren't waiting for write completion there.

What then happens is that sync_inode_metadata() from your fsync
does not call ->write_inode because the inode dirty bits are clear.
It's basically a noop. So you need to either make your .write_inode
always synchronous, or wait for it in your .fsync and .sync_fs.

Sorry, I was looking at the wrong code, ignore that.
