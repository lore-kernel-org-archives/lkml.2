It isn't something we would create, it just would be so itself as a matter of fact. Ultimately, STGT is an user space engine. What it has in the kernel is the interface helper functions to interact with the in-kernel drivers. The simplest way to achieve the ABI compatibility is to make a backend module acting as an STGT in-target driver.

Vlad,

As mentioned explictly earlier in this thread, my WIP code for the
kernel level subsystem backstore using STGT kernel <-> user CDB
passthrough logic in drivers/target/target_core_stgt.c is a item on my
TODO list, but I will repeat, is NOT being tagged as a mainline .37
item.

Tomo-san, mnc, and other storage folks have been briefed on the
remaining issues that would be involved to get a prototype functioning
with drivers/target/target_core_stgt.c, and rough idea of what it would
take in existing mainline drivers/scsi/scsi_tgt_*.c code.  With the
current WIP code this will allow the userspace CDB -> LUN passthrough to
function transparently with all TCM SPC-4 compliant logic as a
standalone struct se_subsystem_api tcm_core_stgt.ko backstore.

Best,

--nab
