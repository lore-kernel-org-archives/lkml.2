Simple.  This key_put() is called from within keyring_destroy() and that is
only ever called from the garbage collector - which is non-reentrant.  Add to
that that key_put() never actually destroys a now-unused key, but merely
schedules the gc for a future run, and it's *that* that searches out unused
keys and deletes them.
