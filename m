Does anybody have any objection to using crc32c (which we can hardware
accelerate on new Intel boxen) over crc16?  I think it'll be pretty easy to use
some of the reserved space in the group descriptor to store checksums of the
block and inode bitmaps.  Adding tails to the extent tree blocks seems a bit
trickier than that, but not a big deal, though I guess I'll have to reshuffle
the extent tree to free up space at the end of the block.

I was also wondering what people think of adding checksums to directory files?
I think that it's possible to put a checksum in each directory block -- for
blocks containing a linear array of actual directory entries, we could zero out
the space past the end of the array and put a checksum at the very end of the
block.  For the dx_node/dx_root blocks, we could probably use the space
occupied by the last dx_entry to store the checksum.  Obviously, we'd have to
move whatever's at the end of the block elsewhere, but then, we have to do that
for the extent tree too.  Basically, the last 4 bytes become the checksum after
whatever's occupying the space is relocated. :)

It looks like there's sufficient unused space in ext4_xattr_header to add a
checksum.

Also -- should I create separate rocompat feature flags for each metadata
object that I add checksums to?  Or just have one flag that covers them all?

Ok, enough crazy ideas for now...
