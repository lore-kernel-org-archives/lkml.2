What's that?

Hm, I don't think there's anything that does that now.  But I think if
you look it up and set the cache item's expiry_time to the current unix
time in seconds, that'd be at least a start.

Come to think of it you should actually be able to do that from
userspace if you want: just write a negative cache entry for that
export.

However you do this there may still be some brief delay while some
thread finishes processing an rpc using the entry; I don't know what to
do about that.  It's unlikely in your case (where clients have unmounted
first).
