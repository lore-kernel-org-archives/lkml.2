I proposed it, we discussed it on the list, and Trond and Steve
committed the patches necessary to make it happen. This was back in
late 2009/early 2010 though, so my memory is a bit fuzzy...

That's different. Not renewing your credentials is often a temporary
situation. Kerberos is different than other authentication methods in
that you get a ticket only for a period of time, so expired credentials
are not a situation that's common with other authentication methods.

The previous situation was also a recipe for disaster, and was often
cited as a primary reason why people didn't want to deploy kerberized
NFS. Having everything fall down and go boom when your ticket expires
is not desirable either.

I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree on this point. That said, I'm
open to sane suggestions however that don't regress the behavior for
those users who need to be able to cope with expired tickets.
