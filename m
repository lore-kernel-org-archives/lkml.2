I really don't think NFSv4 is a separate justification.  I'm fairly sure
that attribute was only including in NFSv4 for enhanced Windows
compatibility (windows interoperation was a big issue during the protocol
development).

That leaves hypothetical "backup/archive applications".  Do you have a
concrete example?  Or we are left with just various flavours of Windows
compatibility (not that I have a problem with Windows compatibility, but if
that is the only reason that we have creation-time then I think it is
important to be clear and open about that).
