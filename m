Read through it, only understood the half of it. But interesting to see 
that there seems to be a real issue.

Memory usage at that time was not different than on other days, so I don't 
know why it had a hard time allocating memory. But I don't have any 
numbers.

OK, will try to get this information the next time this happens.

Yes, the option was already set:

CONFIG_DETECT_HUNG_TASK=y
CONFIG_DEFAULT_HUNG_TASK_TIMEOUT=120
# CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC is not set
CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC_VALUE=0

Thanks for digging through this and for the explanation!
