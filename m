Subject: [PATCH 5/6] jbd2: use WRITE_SYNC for journal I/O
Date: Fri,  2 Jul 2010 15:58:18 -0400

In my fsync testing, journal I/O most definitely was sync I/O, since
another process was blocked waiting for the results.  By marking all
journal I/O as WRITE_SYNC, I can get better performance with CFQ.

If there is a way to mark this only for cases where it is blocking progress
in a dependent process, then that would be preferrable.  Is there such a
means for determining and flagging this?

Cheers,
Jeff
