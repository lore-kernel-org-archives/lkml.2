Yep, this is a valid point.  During the push down this week, I only ran
into a handful (say ~15) overly-complex SHT->queuecommand() w more than
a few return statements.  This was also isoloated for the most part into
legacy/ancient LLDs.

So I really do not have a strong preference here.  I think Boaz's
approach is a bit cleaner, but in the end I think it should not hold up
on a global push-down merge for lio-4.0.git/host_lock-less-for-37-v9.

Also, at this point I have not received any other feedback from LLD
maintainers to say "My LLD should be running in lock-less mode" or "My
LLD cannot run in lock-less mode, and needs the host_lock push down".

One additional point that was raised by jgarzik was that those LLDs
running in 'lock-less' mode may need to have their internal
->queuecommand() spinlocks converted to spin_lock_irqsave() +
spin_unlock_irqrestore().  This has already been fixed for libata
following Jeff's recommendation, but we also identified a few other
potential LLDs that may need more work.  From the last response locatd
here:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=128825558912565&w=2

"Ok, so originally libiscsi, fnic, and lpfc where using
spin_unlock(host->host_lock) -> spin_lock(host->host_lock)

And libsas, qla2xxx, qla4xxx where using
spin_unlock_irq(host->host_lock) -> spin_lock_irq(host->host_lock)

Just to verify, you are thinking that those *not* using spin_unlock_irq
+ spin_lock_irq() for the legacy optimization dispatch should have their
per LLD host lock converted to spin_lock_irqsave() +
spin_unlock_irqrestore(), right..?"

So I think that means an audit of locks obtained in libiscsi, fnic and
lpfc will be in to ensure they do not assume irqs have alreadby been
externally disabled for lock-less operation..

Comments folks..?
