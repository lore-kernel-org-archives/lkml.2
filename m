I don't think it's a problem, because all you're doing is reading 
dev->power.rpm_status -- you're not writing it.

On the other hand, there's nothing really wrong with keeping your own
local copy of rpm_status.  You could think of it as being the queue's
status as opposed to the device's status.  (Also, some people might
argue that dev->power.rpm_status is supposed to be private to the
runtime PM core and shouldn't be used by other code.)
