Hi Amir,

that is why I spoke with several dm people and all of them had the same
opinion. When you are not using the advantage of being at fs level,
there is no reason to have shapshoting at this level.

And no, I am not blinded. I am trying to understand why is multisnap a
huge win everyone is saying, so I already asked ejt to step in and
give us an overview on how dm-multisnap works and why is it better
than the old implementation. Also I am trying it myslef, and so far
it works quite well. I might have some numbers later.

Thanks!
