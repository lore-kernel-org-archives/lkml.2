I have an IBM serveraid 8k which is currently running a 2.6.32 kernel.
I tried booting knoppix 6.4.4 which uses a 2.6.37 kernel to do some disk
rearanging and was rather surprised that the aacraid failed to come up
and instead resulting in the message:

AAC0: adapter kernel panic'd ffffffff
(transcribed by hand from memory, but I am pretty sure they were all f's).

The firmware version on the adapter is 5.2-0[16002].

It is running a single raid5 across four 750GB SATA drives (total of
2.25TB capacity, which has turned out to be a huge pain in the ass,
but that's hopefully an unrelated story).

I would love to know why it works fine with 2.6.32 but fails completely
with 2.6.37.  I can't find any commits in git that seem major enough to
really affect things, but clearly something did.  I am somewhat worried
my next kernel upgrade won't go well.
