Hi Ted,

First of all extremely sorry for causing you inconvenience and making
you use of your time to review such trivial patches.

Yes, we are part of some company and we were looking for Ext4 as the
next big thing and looking forward to adopting that. We really need
complete understanding of Ext4 to stand out and gain confidence
ourselves first. We started with the initial anlalysis of Ext4 and
side-by-side looking at the source code.
As far as submitting patch is concerned - yes, It was part of our
learning curve - that we started the comparision.

In the past, I have literally focussed on our runtime environment and
raised issues. This was the firsttime - that there was something we
saw for code submission(may be just out of our childish curiosity).

I will make sure that there is no more inconvenience of that sort.

Thanks & Regards,
Amit Sahrawat
