Thanks for reviewing.

We have the lock in write mode there, so it should exclude that
particular race. But I need to take another look at this code I
think, I'm not sure it's completely right, so I would appreciate reviews.

A while back I had some extra checks in there and would restart
the entire reverse walk in case of races... but need to think about
it.

Well dget and mntget is not a problem, because we can only do
mntget while already guaranteeing a reference on the mount, and
only dget when already guaranteeing a ref on the dentry (and mount).

But dput must happen before mntput so you don't have dentry ref
without mnt ref. Can you point out where rcu-walk does this wrongly?

Yes I have a patch for that. I made a small hash table of rename locks.
This makes independent same-dir renames scalable. However that was
not the main motivation of the patch. On a really big POWER7 system,
the lookup path goes into a strange bimodal behaviour in the presence
of a relatively small amount of rename activity and sometimes starves
and throughput crashes. Breaking up rename_lock solves that too.

I'll wait until things settle down a bit more and perhaps have a chance
to get more numbers before submitting it (although I can show you when
I get back).

Thanks,
Nick
