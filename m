I'm not sure you even want to pay for a per-filesystem atomic access when
updating mtime.  mnt_want_write - called at the same time - seems to go to
some lengths to avoid an atomic operation.

I think that nfsd should be the only place that has to pay the atomic
penalty, as it is where the need is.

I imagine something like this:
 - Create a global struct timespec which is protected by a seqlock
   Call it current_nfsd_time or similar.
 - file_update_time reads this and uses it if it is newer than
   current_fs_time.
 - nfsd updates it whenever it reads an mtime out of an inode that matches
   current_fs_time to the granularity of 1/HZ.
   If the current value is before current_kernel_time, it
   is set to current_kernel_time, otherwise tv_nsec is incremented -
   unless that increases
   beyond jiffies_to_usec(1)*1000 beyond current_kernel_time.
 - the global 'struct timespec' is zeroed whenever system time is set
   backwards.

Then - providing the fs stores nanosecond timestamps - we should have stable,
globally ordered, precise (if not entirely accurate) time stamps, and a
penalty would only be paid when nfsd actually needs the information.


[[You could probably make ext3 work reasonably well by adding a mount option
  which:
    - advertises s_time_gran as 1
    - when storing: rounds timestamps up to the next second if tv_nsec != 0
    - when loading, setting the timestamp to the current time if the stored
      number matches current_kernel_time().tv_sec+1
  You would get occasional forward jumps in mtime, but usually when you
  aren't looking, and at least you would not get real changes that are not
  reflected in mtime
]]
