This is a cleanup patch set.
It will be followed my LockD start/stop cleanup patch set and NFS callback
service containerization patch set (yes, I forgot to implement it).

Today per-net data is created with service, and then is service is starting in
other network namespace. And thus it's destroyed with service too. Moreover,
network context for destroying of per-net data is taken from current process.
This is correct, but code looks ugly.
This patch set separates per-net data allocation from service allocation and
destruction.
IOW, per-net data have to be destroyed by service users - not service itself.

BTW, NFSd code become uglier with this patch set. Sorry.
But I assume, that these new ugly parts will be replaced later by NFSd service
containerization code.

The following series consists of:

---

Stanislav Kinsbursky (3):
      SUNRPC: new svc_bind() routine introduced
      SUNRPC: check rpcbind clients usage counter before decrement
      SUNRPC: move per-net operations from svc_destroy()
