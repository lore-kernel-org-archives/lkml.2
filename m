Regarding ted's question,
We prevent one node being concentrating workload from redundant
alloc/free by balancing workload to other nodes in performance side.
and we can avoid reclaim probability a little by allocation from only
local node also.
slab caches for extents io of btrfs is set to SLAB_MEM_SPREAD flags
with recliam flags.
