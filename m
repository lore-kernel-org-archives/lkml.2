Few questions/suggestions below but it looks good in general to me.

OK, so the new charges shouldn't come from the IRQ context so we cannot
race with css_tryget but why did we need this in the first place?
A separate patch which removes this with an explanation would be nice.

All the callers seem to be fine but this was a safety net that something
didn't leak out. Can we keep it and test that the reference counter has
been disabled already (css_refcnt(&memcg->css) < 0 - I do not care
whether open coded or wrapped innsude css_is_removed albeit helper
sounds nicer)?

I think that something like the following would be more instructive:

+ * if the mem_cgroup is used for charging. (dropping refcnt from swap can be
+ * called against removed memcg.)

Thanks!
