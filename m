Tuning the child context from the parent context is an entirely
reasonable thing to do.  To affect a namespace that is not yours
the requirement is simply that we don't use current to lookup the
sysctl.  So what I am proposing should work for your case.

The part that keeps it all working is by adding a symlink from /proc/sys
to /proc/self/sys.  That technique has worked well for /proc/net, and I
don't expect there will be any problems with /proc/sys either.  It is
possible but is very rare for the introduction of a symlink in a path
to cause problems.
