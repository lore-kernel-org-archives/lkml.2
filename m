I had thought of implementing a separate lock for throttling. Then I
noticed few operations like checking for queue flags where I would
be required to hold queue locks.

So I could do lock nesting.

hold throttling_lock;
   hold queue_lock;

IIRC, I also had noticed some operations where queue might want to call
into throttling with queue lock held and that would have led to lock
order problems.

So I had given up on the idea and continued to use queue lock for
throttling. Thought it could still probably be done if one could
justify additional complexity.

Thanks
Vivek
