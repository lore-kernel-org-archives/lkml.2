Hmm, if there are a race as you mentioned it can't guarantee enough pages 
is ready. But it also means that available memory is too low if this 
race happen. If available charges still less than nr_pages after 
mem_cgroup_wait_acct_move(which can potentially free some charges) return,
the CHAGE_RETRY will trigged, and then mem_cgroup_do_charge=>meory_cgroup_reclaim
=>mem_cgroup_wait_acct_move, if available charges still less than nr_pages in 
this round, CHAGE_RETRY..... To avoid this infinite retry when available memory 
in this memcg is very low , go to OOM if mem_cgroup_margin(mem_over_limit) 
< nr_pages is a better way I think. Because the codes have already try
its best to reclaim some pages. :-)
