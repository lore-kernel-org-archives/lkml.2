So at fist I did not think this is such a good idea however there
are several good points you've mentioned.

CAP_SYS_RAWIO is indeed too big hammer for this and it is not secure
to allow such application to possess such capability. Moreover
WRITE_SAME indeed is almost the SAME as WRITE :), only easier and
delegated to the storage itself.

UNMAP or WRITE_WAME w/ unamp bit is a little bit trickier but
thinking about it some more I do not see any real reason why the
user with write permission should not be able to use this. Yes, it
is not technically write and it has other consequences as well, but
none of it seems to be exploitable more than simple write.

Moreover looking at BLKDISCARD ioctl there is no such restrictions
(obviously) but neither is with TRIM ata command. So with sata SSD
you're allowed to use TRIM command if you have write permission to
that device. So I guess having this consistent is good idea and
considering the points above I think it is ok to allow WRITE_SAME
and UNMAP without CAP_SYS_RAWIO.

Thanks!
