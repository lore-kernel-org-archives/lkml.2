Yes (though I'm not powering off, just rebooting). Battery at 100% and
happy, though the lack of power-off means it's not actually getting
used, since the cache is obviously mains-backed as well.

Rebooting cleanly, everything umounted happily including /home and /var.

My memory says yes, but nothing seems to be logged when this happens
(though with my logs on the first filesystem damaged by this, this is
rather hard to tell, they're all quite full of NULs by now).

I'll double-reboot tomorrow via the faulty kernel and check, unless I
get asked not to in the interim. (And then double-reboot again to fsck
everything...)

OK, well, I've been 'testing' it for years :) No problems until now. (If
anything, I was more concerned about journal_checksum. I thought that
had actually been implicated in corruption before now...)

> * Can you reproduce this w/o journal_async_commit?

I can try!
