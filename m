  Well, not sure if you remember but the change I was proposing was only
for filesystems that would promise (in their fstype) they they know better
how to handle IO errors.

  That's another possibility but a flag in fstype and a check in default
end-of-io handler looked like an easier solution to me.

  I agree that just keeping the uptodate flag was a half-baked proposal. I
ultimately want to set the dirty flag back as well and we seem to agree
that that would be logically correct. But then, as you noted, filesystem
has to propely handle unwriteable pages to not bring system OOM (or
actually block all writes due to exceeded dirty limit) and that is more
complicated (distinguishing path temporarily down from USB stick is gone
etc.) so I didn't want to go there in the beginning. But it seems I'll have
to ;)
