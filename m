We hoped JBD2 could take care of the batching too. But ftrace shows
there are a fair amount of barriers (440 barriers/second, if I remember
right) sending from ext4_sync_file(), but not coming from jbd2 side. :(

I don't like a new mount option too. Darrick's new mount option is for
the threshold to turn on/off batching. Probably could make it a tunables
instead of a mount option.
