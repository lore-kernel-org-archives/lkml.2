That's side-tracking. This is one way to do it, not the way to do it.
The main point is that a controller can be trivially made present in a 
hierarchy, without doing anything.

It makes less sense to me now after I read Frederic's last e-mail.

Okay.

I may agree with you, I might not.

It really depends on Frederic's real use case - (Frederic, please 
comment on it).

If we're trying to limit the number of processes *as a way* of limiting 
the amount of memory they use, then yes, what you say makes total sense.

I was always under the assumption that they wanted something more. One 
of the things I remember reading on the descriptions, was that some 
services shouldn't be allowed to fork after a certain point. Then you 
could limit its amount of processes to whatever value it has now.

For that, stack usage may not help for much.

Now, my personal take on this: Use cases like that, if really needed, 
can be achieved in some other ways, that does not even involve cgroups.

One of the things for the near future, is start putting more kinds of 
data in the kmem controller. Things like page tables and the stack are 
the natural candidates. I am in Hannes side in saying that it should be 
enough to disallow any malicious container to do any harm.

But it is not even necessary!

- Each process has a task struct
- task struct comes from the slab.

Even my slab accounting patches are enough to prevent harm outside the 
container. Because if you fill all your kmem with task_structs, you will 
be stopped to go any further.

As a matter of fact, I've being doing it all the time during the last 
few days while testing the patchset.
