Hi Nick.
Thanks for digging into this issue, I bet it's causing pain. Which
I totally missed in my tests. I wish I had a better xsync+reboot
tests for all this.

So in that previous patch you had:

Is that a good enough fix for the issue in your opinion?
Or is there more involved?

In exofs there is nothing special to do other than VFS
managment and the final call, by vfs, to .write_inode.

I wish we had a simple_file_fsync() from VFS that does
what the VFS expects us to do. So when code evolves it
does not need to change all FSs. This is the third time
I'm fixing this code trying to second guess the VFS.

Actually the only other thing I need to do in file_fsync
today is sb_sync. But this is a stupidity (and a bug) that
I'm fixing soon. So that theoretical simple_file_fsync()
would be all I need.

Please advise?
BTW: Do you want that I take the changes through my tree?

Thanks for taking care of this
Boaz
