And this is where things get really ugly of course :-).

For the CIFSFS client they're expecting to be able to
just ship them to a Windows server, where they'll
get the (insane) Windows semantics. These semantics
are not what would be wanted on a local filesystem.

So unless we just say "these things have Windows
semantics" (where openers of files can lock out others
under dubious circumstances) there'll be this horrible
difference between (I'm assuming) the sane semantics that
are defined for local filesystems and the insane ones
that you get when you're connecting remotely.

I don't know a good way to fix that, but I'm pretty
sure you don't want the Windows semantics defined
locally :-).

Jeremy.
