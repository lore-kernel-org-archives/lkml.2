We have a (pretty crude) counter in the driver but no timing mechanism. We could add a timer. But what's a suitable timeout value? Is 2 seconds too short, too long? Suggestions, please.

I know that a counter isn't a ground-breaking idea, just wanted to show some interest :)
The command can be either eaten by the firmware or during the communication in or out from the device.
I'd would start by the communication, by adding some fields to the command to detect if a command in the row(s) isn't
missing - I know even that isn't easy. The same could be done independently done for the other direction.
