>>> The only thing stopping me from getting the speed is the fact that struct fw_request is opaque. The value is easily available from request->response.speed and I kind of do that already in a very hackish way. I've sent a separate patch which adds a function that can be used to access that one value.

As far as I'm aware I must call fw_send_response() from within the callback and can't defer that until I've scheduled something on a work queue. Please correct me if I'm wrong though, as that might be useful anyway.

Hmm sorry I've thought about this overnight and clearly I was talking 
rubbish. Yes, I need to reply in the fw_address_handler but all I tend 
to do in there is schedule a task to the the main part of the work 
anyway. As most of the operations require fetching an ORB from the 
initiator I have to do this from user context.

So it's possible I could do this by waiting in my scheduled work 
function until the fw_node is available and get the speed from that - 
but that seems like an inordinate amount of work when I can follow the 
standard and do it really easily by pulling it out of the fw_request.
