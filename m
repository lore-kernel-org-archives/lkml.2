So, Al or Christoph: NFS calls up to rpcbind from the kernel using
AF_LOCAL, so it looks up a path when it connects.  We'd like to export
set_fs_root() so we can temporarily put our task in the right namespace
around the connect call.  Is that reasonable?

I just want to get a reason on record so we stop going in circles here.
