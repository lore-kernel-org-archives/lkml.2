I personally think 'we punish it later' is bad thing at resource accounting.
We have 'hard limit'. It's not soft limit.

Allowing people to bypass is not bad because they're kernel.

But, IIUC, from gfp.h
==
 * __GFP_NOFAIL: The VM implementation _must_ retry infinitely: the caller
 * cannot handle allocation failures.  This modifier is deprecated and no new
 * users should be added.
==

GFP_NOFAIL will go away and no new user is recommended.

So, please skip GFP_NOFAIL accounting and avoid to write
"usage may go over limit if you're unfortune, sorry" into memcg documentation.

My stand point is keeping "usage <= limit" is the spec. and
important in enterprise system. So, please avoid usage > limit.
