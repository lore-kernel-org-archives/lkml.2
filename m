  data=writeback can cause larger data loss and stale data exposure but it
actually shouldn't cause filesystem corruption about which you write in the
changelog below. I'd much rather attribute the metadata corruption to a missing
barrier option or barrier support in the virtualization stack. But I guess it's
hard to tell now.
  Anyways, I agree with you that data=ordered is a saner default so I'll
push your change.
