OK. Further testing seems to indicate that we're going to have to
postpone merging these patches until the 3.4 merge window.

The problems are twofold:

As the patches stand now in the linux-next tree, they can (and
occasionally do) Oops on unmount. The reason was that I rejected the
PipeFS notifier patch for the idmapper (due to the reported problem of
nfs_idmap_init/nfs_idmap_quit being undefined when CONFIG_NFS_V4 is
undefined), and the fact that it is missing causes the unmount at the
end of our tests to hit the BUG() in fs/dcache.c:905. This suggests that
we will have the same problem with the pNFS block layout driver, since I
still haven't received a rebased update of the 5 'create blocklayout
pipe per network namesapce context' patches.

The second problem that was highlighted was the fact that as they stand
today, these patchsets do not allow for bisection. When we hit the Oops,
I had Bryan try to bisect where the problem arose. He ended up pointing
at the patch "SUNRPC: handle RPC client pipefs dentries by network
namespace aware routine", which is indeed the cause, but which is one of
the _dependencies_ for all the PipeFS notifier patches that fix the
problem.
