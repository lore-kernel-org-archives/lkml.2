Agreed.

We should update that documentation.

It's automatic.  You can turn them off on the server side with
/proc/sys/fs/leases-enable.  They'll be turned off automatically if the
server can't open a tcp connection back to the client (for example, if
the client is behind a NAT).

I haven't used that.  I don't believe there's anything NFSv4-specific
about it.
