I suppose.  It's cleaner, though, to keep them separate.

No, you can't.  32-bit systems can only pass 32-bit arguments.  If you're
suggesting passing a pointer to a 64-bit argument instead, how's that any
different from my suggestion of a separate parameter block?

Urgh.  Netlink is way too much overhead and even scarier.  That's pretty much
a guarantee that people won't use it.  It also has to work if CONFIG_NET=n.
