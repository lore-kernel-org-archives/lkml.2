Sure, that makes sense for the legacy drivers running in host_lock
mode..  But with the fully lock-less LLDs (like the freshly minted
tcm_loop patch to go fully lock-less), this is a easier transitional
step from:

full host_lock push down ->

	lock_less w/ atomic_t host serial_number counter ->

		lock_less w/o atomic cmd->serial_number counter + 
                scsi_error.c changes

So my tenative plan is to enable the host_lock less LLDs we know about
(include tcm_loop and core-iscsi) with the atomic_t serial number
counter, and continue getting polling feedback from various LLD
maintainers..  This part will be tagged as a for-38 branch.

Understood, so at least for the moment this is not an immediate
addressable item unless andmike, hch or someone else wants to take
another look at extracting the ghosts from this code.

Until then I will keep the atomic_t serial_number counter in
lio-core-2.6.git code, and plan to push the usage back down for the 5
legacy LLDs once scsi_error.c can be sorted out.

Best,
