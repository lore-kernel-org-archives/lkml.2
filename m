Still no fatal errors, but the problem is still happening regularly. It causes 
a pause in disk io of a couple seconds at least. Really quite annoying.

One thing thats got me wondering, is could this be a power issue? It almost 
seems like (from the messages) that a single drive (any drive) is freaking 
out, and returning an error that probably shouldn't happen (no CHS 0?), which 
could mean the drive is underpowered and the firmware is flipping out. I'm not 
entirely sure. The system has a 750w decent quality Antec power supply. The 
total power use of the system shouldn't come over half that (phenom II x4 810 
cpu, gigabyte ma790fxtud5p mb, low profile nvidia 9400GS gpu, 8 sata hdds, 3 
fans, etc). I'm /mostly/ sure the 12v rails are spread out evenly, but I have 
yet to make absolutely sure.

But then it doesn't seem as if the root drives are ever flipping out. Theres 
two 500GB Seagate 7200.12 drives md raid1'ed on the motherboard's (SB750) sata 
II controller. They work fine, no messages regarding them at all the entire 
time. However I get frequent and repeated messages from all drives on the 
mvsas based controller.

So color me stumped.
