Hmm. let me see....at quick glance cgroup_lock() is used at
  hierarchy policy change
  kmem_limit
  migration policy change
  swapiness change
  oom control

Because all aboves takes care of changes in hierarchy,
Having a new memcg's mutex in ->create() may be a way.

Ah, hm, Costa is mentioning task-attach. is the task-attach problem in memcg ?

Thanks,
