I see.

Yeah, I was basically suggesting to forget about cache flush w/ mpath
until it can be fixed.  You're saying that if mpath just passes
REQ_FLUSH upwards without retrying, it will be almost unuseable,
right?  I'm not sure how to proceed here.  How much work would
discerning between transport and IO errors take?  If it can't be done
quickly enough the retry logic can be kept around to keep the old
behavior but that already was a broken behavior, so...  :-(

Thanks.
