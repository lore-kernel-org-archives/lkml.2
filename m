ah, Let me say its scenario at first. If we do two mount ops as below:
1.) mount -o loop,hot_track image1 /data1
2.) mount -o loop,hot_track image2 /data2

The mount -o hot_track operation will automatically create one sysfs
directory /sys/kernel/debug/hot_track. To prevent this dir being
created again when 2.) is done, we need to know if it has existed at
first. In my patch, i at first get its dentry by this new function,
then determine if its d_inode field is NULL, if no, it means that this
sysfs dir has existed.
This is the reason that i want to add one new function.

Because i can't find one appropriate place to save it.
