I have been reluctant to boot to 2.6.35-rc due to the large set of
regression list and the amount of work I needed to actually get done
on 2.6.35. Last I checked the regression list it was getting small so
I gave it a spin today. No luck. I get some bootup error from udevd
and ext2/ext3/ext4, something like this:

EXT3-fs (sda1): error: couldn't mount because of unsupported optional
features (240)
EXT2-fs (sda1): error: couldn't mount because of unsupported optional
features (240)
EXT4-fs (sda1): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Opts: (null)
VFS: Mounted root (ext4 filesystem) readonly on device 8:1
Freeing unused kernel memory: 708k freed
Write protecting the kernel read-only data: 102040k
Freeing unused kernel memory: 764k freed
Freeing unused kernel memory: 1796k freed
udevd: failed to create queue file: No such file or directory
udevd: error creating queue file

The picture:

I then decided to pull Linus' latest but it didn't help either. I
don't recall seeing this reported on the regression list yet.
Essentially I cannot move forward after this happens, even on single
user boot and disabling wireless, which was my main suspect first as
I'm using wireless-testing.git.

I can certainly bisect but first wanted to see if this was already known.


mcgrof@tux ~/wireless-testing (git::sfo-02)$ grep CONFIG_EXT .config

Let me know if you need more details.
