Since NFSv4 doesn't have a separate MOUNT protocol, clients need to be
able to do readdir's and lookups to get to exported filesystems.  We
support this in the Linux server by exporting all the filesystems from
"/" on down that must be traversed to reach a given filesystem.  These
exports are very restricted (e.g. only parents of exports are visible).

That might work.  It's read-only and consists only of directories, so
the grace period doesn't affect it.
