The basic problem isn't devices lying ... the worst we'll do is current
behaviour (not SYNC when we should).  The problem is devices that get
confused (or worse simply crash the firmware).  The best way to avoid
the crashing firmware problem ... if we can assume that modern USB
devices are better is to key off the SCSI version.  Unfortunately, in
spite of several attempts, we've never managed to stop usbstorage lying
about this:

		/* Some devices report a SCSI revision level above 2 but are
		 * unable to handle the REPORT LUNS command (for which
		 * support is mandatory at level 3).  Since we already have
		 * a Get-Max-LUN request, we won't lose much by setting the
		 * revision level down to 2.  The only devices that would be
		 * affected are those with sparse LUNs. */
		if (sdev->scsi_level > SCSI_2)
			sdev->sdev_target->scsi_level =
					sdev->scsi_level = SCSI_2;

Untangling all of this would be rather complex, I fear.

The final question is is it worth it?  Since USB devices are supposed to
be hot unpluggable, surely a USB device with a write back cache would be
a disaster: no-one will SYNC the cache on a surprise unplug anyway ...
therefore there shouldn't really be any of them surviving in the wild
(famous last words, I suppose).
