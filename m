Nothing. I still hate them. But the tools I use (web interface to
gmail) are broken in this respect. There's no way to include a file,
or specify that an attachement should be inlined. And don't tell me
about IMAP - if I wanted to use IMAP, I'd be living in a padded cell.

I have a deep love/hate relationship with gmail. Many things make it
wonderful, and I'm not regretting the switch (which was initially just
a trial while traveling).

But it has two issues that I absolutely detest:
 (a) the idiotic inability to inline attachements and
 (b) the android gmail app is a total piece of shit and cannot even do
simple text messages. Crazy.
(there are other small annoyances, but they are smallish in comparison
to the above big honking bugs)

Does anybody know anybody who works on the google mail clients and
could raise these as bugs inside google?
