Lets step back a bit.

The retry is needed when when we discover during ->getattr() that the
cached lookup returned a stale file handle.

If the lookup wasn't cached or if there was no lookup at all
(stat(".") and friends) then retrying will not gain anything.

And that also means that retrying multiple times is pointless, since
after the first retry we are sure to have up-to-date attributes.

Unfortunately it's impossible for the filesystem to know whether a
->getattr (or other inode operation) was perfromed after a cached or a
non-cached lookup.

I'm not sure what the right interface for this would be.  One would be
to just pass the "cached-or-not" information as a flag.  That works for
getattr() but not for other operations.

Another is to introduce atomic lookup+foo variants of these operations
just like for open.  E.g. the lookup+getattr is called if the cached
lookup fails or if the cached lookup succeeds and the plain ->getattr
call returns ESTALE.

Thanks,
Miklos
