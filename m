Sure, but they're not shipped, right ... it's like the test builds we do
for large companies like IBM and HP to try out certain things before
deciding they don't work.

OK, so this may be the root cause of the problem.  DID_TARGET_FAILURE
returns FAILED from scsi_decide_disposition().  This wakes up the error
handler to retry the command and, since the command is never going to
work, this ends up offlining the device.  The same thing will happen for
every command with no recovery.

The question now is, what else returns SRB_STATUS_ERROR?  If it's always
for stuff that's unretryable, then the DID_ error is wrong and you
should be returning DID_PASSTHROUGH with an error code and the problem
will be solved.  If we can get SRB_STATUS_ERROR on retryable commands,
then you discriminate at the point of failure, not at the point of input
and return DID_TARGET_FAILURE for the ones that should be retried and
DID_PASSTHROUGH + error for the ones that shouldn't.  This will ensure
the driver is completely backwards compatible and that it will work
if/when windows properly handles the commands.
