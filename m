This is why the DIF/DIX spec has the idea of a crc generated in userland
when the data is generated.  At any rate the basic idea is to crc early
but not often...recalculating the crc after we hand our precious memory
to the evil device driver does weaken the end-to-end integrity checks.

What I don't want to do is weaken the basic DIF/DIX structure by letting
the lower recrc stuff as they find faults.  It would be fine if we had
some definitive way to say: the FS raced, just recrc, but we really
don't.

So, changing gears to how do we protect filesystem page cache pages
instead of the generic idea of dif/dix, btrfs crcs just before writing,
which does leave a pretty big window for the page to get corrupted.
The storage layer shouldn't care or know about that though, we hand it a
crc and it makes sure data matching that crc goes to the media.

Yeah, I do agree here.
