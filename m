I thought vs_hidden was set for NFSACL... but maybe I was wrong about that.

Yes.  As a simple hard-headed approach, probably you should walk the passed-in sv_program list again and unregister each item in the list.  The downside to this is if the upcall is taking a long time (for instance, if networking is not available).  It would double the amount of time for svc_register() to return a failure.

However, be prepared: I bet such a change could expose bugs in the NFSD start up stack.  :-(  Maybe it deserves some soak-time in linux-next.
