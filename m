This is fine, but not really very useful

This can't really be done generically.  There are several considerations
to do with hardware requirements.  I can see some hw requiring a
specific write order (I think this applies more to read order, though).

The specific mpt2sas problem is that if we write a 64 bit register non
atomically, we can't allow any interleaving writes for any other region
on the chip, otherwise the HW will take the write as complete in the 64
bit register and latch the wrong value.  The only way to achieve that
given the semantics of writeq is a global static spinlock.

Having x86 roll its own never made any sense, so I think they need
reverting anyway.  This is a driver/platform bus problem not an
architecture problem.  The assumption we can make is that the platform
CPU can write atomically at its chip width.  We *may* be able to make
the assumption that the bus controller can translate an atomic chip
width transaction to a single atomic bus transaction; I think that
assumption holds true for at least PCI and on the parisc legacy busses,
so if we can agree on semantics, this should be a global define
somewhere.  If there are problems with the bus assumption, we'll likely
need some type of opt-in (or just not bother).
