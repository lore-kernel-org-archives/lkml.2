It's nice to hear from legal counsel on this matter.

I don't think that the *usage* of the kernel APIs is the biggest issue
here. There are many examples where proprietary code uses these APIs
and is not violating the GPL.

As I see it, one of the main concerns is because the proprietary and
in-kernel target systems are, from what I understand, quite similar,
there is the possibility that GPL licensed contributions to the
in-kernel target code may have "leaked" into to the proprietary code.
That said, proving this is a very difficult problem, but the question
must still be asked:

Can Rising Tide Systems assure us that there is no GPL licensed code
within their proprietary target code?

Thanks,
