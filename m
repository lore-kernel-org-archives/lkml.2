That would be nice.  HPC folks have been looking for this functionality 
for some time now.

The problem is that groupings that may seem logical now may not match 
reality for some specific file system for various implementation reasons.  
IMO a bit per field makes the most sense, with some simple way to include 
all fields (-1 or 0).  A mask argument that is separate from flags might 
make that simpler?
