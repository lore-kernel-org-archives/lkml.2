kmalloc_sizes.h said it could be quite a big :(

Actually I though about slab-cache with 64 bytes per object, but it
requires more code to push here, that is why I stopped. Still this
doesn't justify me. So yes, bad idea. Thanks!

In real, for the particular case where we use this /proc/pid/map_files
it could be done in one pass without mmap_sem taken (since we use it
when task is frozen and we know noone is poking vmas) but the problem
is that people might start using it not for c/r but in various different
cases when task is pretty running and I wanna give them more-less robust
result in ls -l over this directory.

Andrew, I'll think some more, probably I'll find a way to drop this two
passes requirement.
