Balancing.

What conditions do we want to provide?
Why won't we get utilization slump in future?
How do we need to fix things when something goes wrong?
Whereas in accordance with the single existing paper Btrfs
design looks really broken, because:
1. the balancing condition n <= number_of_keys <= 2n+1
   is not satisfied (indeed, when number_of_keys is 1
   we have 1 <= 2n+1 -- false);
2. the trees mentioned in this paper don't allow keys of
   variable length.

Thanks,
Edward.
