Of course you can find remnants of btime in Linux's BSD-style task 
accounting, but Linux always looked more like SysV than BSD, speaking 
for otime. And if you are using autoconf, the cost of using otime over 
btime seems the same.

Well, in all reference to the Matrix movie, files aren't born. Except 
for Directory Default ACLs and possibly security labels, they usually 
don't inherit either :)  And on a CS level, it's more like copy than 
inherit, because if the parent changes, the file does not (with the 
potential exception of security relabeling, bla).
