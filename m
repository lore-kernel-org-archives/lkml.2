Jeff even if journal is not on same device, what harm yielding could do?
Anyway there is no IO on that queue and we are idling. Only side affect is
that yielding process could lose a bit if after fsync it immediately submits
more IO. Because this process has yielded it slice, it is back in the queue
instead of doing more IO in the current slice immediately.
