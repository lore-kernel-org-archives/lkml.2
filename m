well I think that the mount option overrides the on disk value, since the
first thing that ext4_get_stripe_size() does is look for s_stripe
and return it if it's already set.

I just think it's good to keep this stuff consolidated, and not
sprinkle special-cases and error checking around in the code 
too much... complicated enough already IMHO.
