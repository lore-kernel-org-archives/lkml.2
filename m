Would s/3rd party/proprietary/ be OK?

There are other proprietary multipath drivers (e.g. veritas DMP).  So
the issue is theoretically more generic than powerpath.  But in practice
powerpath is the most widely deployed conflict that motivated this
change.

Though I could easily imagine our policy to treat Powerpath with kid
gloves has made us unaware of the potential for other proprietary
multipath drivers having the same conflict with scsi_dh.

FYI, I'm looking to have RHEL7 blaze trails and shake things up by
forcing proprietary multipath drivers to detach scsi_dh (EMC is aware of
this).
