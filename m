Perhaps ATA TRIM is enabled for this SSD in 2.6.35 but not in 2.6.34?
Or the discard code has been changed to issue many moderately sized ATA
TRIMs instead of a single huge one, and the former was much more optimal
for your particular SSD?

At the moment when the administrator creates swap space, the kernel can
assume that he has no use anymore for the data that may have existed
previously at this space.  Hence instruct the SSD's flash translation
layer to return all these blocks to the list of unused logical blocks
which do not have to be read and backed up whenever another logical
block within the same erase block is written to.

However, I am surprised that this is done every time (?) when preparing
for hibernation.
