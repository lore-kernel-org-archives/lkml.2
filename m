Because we can't distinguish between that case and a case where
retrying may help. If we can avoid failing altogether, isn't that
preferable?

If we're just going to retry once, then I see no need to bother with a
fs flag. Retrying once should be harmless for all filesystems. The main
reason to bother with a per-fs flag is to deal with those that would
have problems looping indefinitely on an ESTALE return from the
operation.

So, to give your proposal some "legs", you'd prefer to see something
like this?

[PATCH] vfs: make fstatat retry once on ESTALE errors from getattr call

A third patch. This one takes the minimalist approach. It only retries
once per syscall.
