Yep.  On the other hand, none of the code won't actually allow to use
user@domain identifiers, it won't help with other identifier types like
Windows SIDs, and it doesn't make the code any prettier, so this should
probably go away.

I really don't see this happen anytime soon, and likely not at all.

The filesystem still wouldn't have namespace ids for the owner and
owning group, which is a much bigger issue.  I think we're safe not to
worry about namespace ids at this point; they also might never happen.

That makes sense to me.

There seems to be a WELL_KNOWN_SID_TYPE enumeration which maps those
kinds of special identifiers to small integers in Windows; maybe it
makes sense to use the same numbers for OWNER@, GROUP@, and EVERYONE@.

The acl itself has a version field, so new formats could be introduced
in the future with a new version.

Thanks,
