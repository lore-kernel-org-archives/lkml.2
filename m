Then it sounds like the best idea is something like what Ming proposed 
earlier: Have the error handler make some sort of test to determine 
whether it has been invoked for suspend/resume handling, and skip the 
runtime-PM calls on the host if it has.

This new test, whatever it is, should apply both to system suspend and 
runtime suspend.  By the way, what would happen if a system suspend 
occurred while the ATA port was already runtime-suspended?
