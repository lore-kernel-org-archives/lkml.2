I imagine a new field in 'struct bio' which was normally zero but could be
some small integer.  It is only meaningful for read.
When 0 it means "get this data way you like".
When non-zero it means "get this data using method N", where the different
methods are up to the device.

For a mirrored RAID, method N means read from device N-1.
For stripe/parity RAID, method 1 means "use other data blocks and parity
blocks to reconstruct data.

The default for non RAID devices is to return EINVAL for any N > 0.
A remapping device (dm-linear, dm-stripe etc) would just pass the number
down.  I'm not sure how RAID1 over RAID5 would handle it... that might need
some thought.

So if btrfs reads a block and the checksum looks wrong, it reads again with
a larger N.  It continues incrementing N and retrying until it gets a block
that it likes or it gets EINVAL.  There should probably be an error code
(EAGAIN?) which means "I cannot work with that number, but try the next one".

It would be trivial for me to implement this for RAID1 and RAID10, and
relatively easy for RAID5.
I'd need to give a bit of thought to RAID6 as there are possibly multiple
ways to reconstruct from different combinations of parity and data.  I'm not
sure if there would be much point in doing that though.

It might make sense for a device to be able to report what the maximum
'N' supported is... that might make stacked raid easier to manage...
