Is there a mail thread somewhere with a summary of the objections?

OK.  But the current implementation will leave all the server threads in
the initial pid namespace, too.

And we're stuck with that problem either way too, aren't we?

I have to admit for my purposes I don't care too much about pid
namespaces or about signalling server threads.  It'd be nice to get
those things right but it wouldn't bother me that much not to.

Another stupid idea: can we do our own implementation of something like
kthreadd just for the purpose of starting rpc server threads?  It
doesn't seem that complicated.
