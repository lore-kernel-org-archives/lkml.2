Well, initially I meant to just try the whole set, but now that I try 
just one of them, I find that I get further with only the first one.  I 
think Yongqiang and I have a similar set up because I get the hang if I 
dont have the first patch, and I get the fsx write failure (in about 20 
or so minutes) if I have the second one.  But I think Yongqiang's right, 
we need to figure out why the page is uptodate when it shouldn't be.
