Sounds fair.

We do have a request_firmware() interface and a binary blob generation 
utility in drivers/scsi/isci/firmware/, but that is only for the 
fallback (unable to retrieve from platform-firmware) case and should 
probably be considered a bios bug.  The expectation is that globally 
unique sas address, phy signal-amplification, and default port 
configuration settings are a per-board property set by the OEM in the 
factory.

Ideally this would have been something that just showed up in an 
option-rom bar on the device, but that did not happen so it is left to 
software.  For legacy-bios we scan adapter rom space looking for our 
table, for efi it's comparatively cleaner we just grab this efi variable 
identified by its own GUID.

We could have userspace rebuild the firmware image based on what it 
finds in the platform firmware... but that becomes a messy management 
step and gets confusing if one ever wants to override the platform 
defaults with a custom blob.

Other options?

Also fair.  I suspect we can get through the backlog in that time.

Ok.  I'll continue to post "[GIT] isci" updates to announce the 
intermediate state, but will drop full patch sets to the mailing list 
when we have upstream merge candidates ready for review.
