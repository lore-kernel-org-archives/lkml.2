Good question! I didn't test fat pipelines, which sure asks for reasonably high
nfs_congestion_kb to work well.

However we have good chances.

The nfs_congestion_kb is computed at module loading time in
nfs_init_writepagecache():

        /*
         * NFS congestion size, scale with available memory.
         *
         *  64MB:    8192k
         * 128MB:   11585k
         * 256MB:   16384k
         * 512MB:   23170k
         *   1GB:   32768k
         *   2GB:   46340k
         *   4GB:   65536k
         *   8GB:   92681k
         *  16GB:  131072k
         *
         * This allows larger machines to have larger/more transfers.
         * Limit the default to 256M
         */

For a typical mem=4GB client, nfs_congestion_kb=64MB, which is enough
to fill a 100ms*100MB/s=10MB network pipeline.

There may be more demanding ones, however that's rare case and its
user should be fully aware of the specialness and the need to do some
hand tuning, for example:

        echo $(300<<10) > /proc/sys/fs/nfs/nfs_congestion_kb

Thanks,
Fengguang
