We need to test it, but I think you're probably correct,
6577aac01f00636c16cd583c30bd4dedf18475d5 "nfsd4: fix failure to end
nfsd4 grace period" should have been tagged for stable.  Does that also
require any previous patches? (E.g.
48483bf23a568f3ef4cc7ad2c8f1a082f10ad0e7 "nfsd4: simplify recovery dir
setting"?)
