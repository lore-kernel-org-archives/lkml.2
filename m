Adding Uli to the Cc list to make sure this system call is useful
for glibc / can be exported by it.  Otherwise it's rather pointless
to add it.

How is this different from (1) and (4)?

What do you mean with that?

What for?

Why making them large for the sake of it?  We'll need massive changes
all through libc and applications to ever make use of this.  So please
coordinate the types used with Uli.

Just pass this as a single flag by value.  And just make it an unsigned
long to make the calling convention a lot simpler.

> 		unsigned int		major, minor;

No point in adding special types here that aren't genericly useful.
Also this is the first and only system call using split major/minor
values for the dev_t.  All this just creates more churn than it helps.

Just st_mask?

> 		unsigned long long	st_data_version;

st version?

> 		unsigned long long	st_inode_flags;

What's the point of the REQUEST in the name?  Also no double
underscores inside the identifier.  Instead adding a _MASK postfix
for masks would make it a lot more clear.

Please don't overload the FL_ namespace even more.  It's already a
complete mess given that it overloads the extN on-disk namespace.
You're much better off just adding a clean new namespace.

If you already have a buflen parameter there is absolute no need for
the extra results field.  Just define new fields at the end and include
them if the bufsize is big enough and it's in the mask of requested
fields.

Why add a special case like that?  Especially if we make the request
flags a pass by value scalar initalizing it is trivial.

Please don't introduce tons of special cases.  Instead use a simple rule
like:

 - a filesystem must return all attributes requests, or return an
   error if it can't.
 - a filesystem may return additional attributes, the caller can detect
   this by looking at st_mask.

plus possibly a list of attributes the filesystem must be able to
provide if requests.  I don't see a reason to make that mask different
from the attributes required by Posix.
