I've not seen a hang myself.  I'm reluctant to drop the second patch,
since it appears to fix the real problems (oops and corruption) that
I have seen, and fsx fails with or without it; but I don't know whether
it's any better than simply reverting yours.

I would certainly like fsx under memory pressure to be reliable again -
that will help all our testing of new changes; but I think it's more
urgent to get normal loads to be reliable again.

If you can call building on -t ext2 -b 1024 under memory pressure normal ;)
