Oh, yes -- I knew I had forgotten something.

The client driver has to be changed.  That means scsi_sysfs_add_sdev() 
should call block_pm_runtime_init().

scsi_runtime_suspend() should call block_pre_runtime_suspend() and fail
if that routine returns an error.  Then after calling
scsi_dev_type_suspend(), it should call block_post_runtime_suspend() 
to let it know whether the suspend operation succeeded.

Similarly, scsi_runtime_resume() should call block_pre_runtime_resume() 
before scsi_dev_type_resume() and block_post_runtime_resume() 
afterward.

Once that's done, you can remove the scsi_autpm stuff from sd_open() 
and sd_release().
