All the above can be implemented in STGT. Considering that they were 
only recently added in TCM, why they were not added in STGT instead?

This sounds very attractive, but not practical. Because of fundamental 
architectural differences, you'd end up with 2 separate somehow coupled 
subsystems doing the same things by 2 different interfaces. Definitely, 
this ugly end result would not be something which everybody liked and 
expected.

Year, you are making from the "partially available" the "fully 
available" code.

Names, please.

Do you mean Netgear 
(http://old.nabble.com/Re%3A-Invalid-module-format---no-symbol-version-formodule_layout-p27116634.html)?

Anyway, it is apparent that open source LIO/TCM you are pushing has none 
or very few production users and there are no signs it is changing. 
Users prefer alternative solutions.

Moreover, I have not seen any positive reference about production usage 
of LIO/TCM anywhere, the only reference I've seen so far was the above 
negative feedback about the Netgear experience.

Size of the users base has always been one of the main arguments.

Nicholas,

I have been working in area of SCSI targets since 2003, I have created 
the best OSS SCSI target subsystem which is widely used and getting 
better and better every day. I am one of few people among recipients of 
this thread who has sufficient knowledge and experience to be able see 
the whole picture and be able to evaluate quality and consequences of 
the code and architectural decisions in this area. (Even deep experience 
in SCSI initiator side development is not quite sufficient for that, 
because SCSI initiator and target sides solve completely different tasks 
[1].) If something isn't clear for me, I can simply look in the source 
code and quickly find out the answers.

<MOANING ON>

Actually, I'd prefer to stay away from all those TCM discussions and let 
somebody similarly skillful to judge. But, since there is no such person 
appearing, I have to participate myself to explain the real state of 
things and let people judge based on _facts_, not the marketing stuff 
you are too often presenting. So far too much of what you have written 
after closer examinations turned out to be a misleading half-truth as in 
this particular case, where the end result isn't going to be what 
everybody would expect hearing about "TCM and STGT compatibility" or as 
it was before with "1 to many" pass-through which only sometimes "1 to 
many", otherwise not enforced "1 to 1", welcoming data corruption, or 
even before with Persistent Reservations which worked as expected only 
with a single connected initiator, etc.. I have to explain everybody for 
who it isn't obvious what is true and what is NOT true in your 
"half-truth". Competition is a good thing, but without all those 
undercover dirty marketing games which I'm really tired. They are 
disgusting.

You'd end up in one of 2 options:

1. You'd make TCM to pass-through requests from its target drivers 
("fabric modules" in your terminology) directly to the STGT core in the 
user space bypassing TCM's internal memory management and target state 
machine, i.e. effectively make them behave as STGT target drivers. As 
the result, we would have 2 separate interfaces (TCM and STGT) doing the 
same thing as well as 2 sets of target drivers and 2 sets of backend 
handlers from each interface. That apparently wouldn't be a Linux's way 
of doing things. It wouldn't be moving forward, it would be moving in 
the maintenance hell.

2. You'd just throw away existing STGT messages and add new ones. Then 
add in STGT a big "TCM compatibility" level to make STGT and it's 
backend be able to use the new messages and work with new model with 
memory management and target state machine in the kernel. Obviously, it 
would be even uglier than (1).

But it's an Open Source, so you can do whatever you want. Show us the 
code and we will see. My intention is only to _warn_ people that they 
shouldn't count on your (marketing) plans, because there are fundamental 
reasons preventing them be implemented in an acceptable way.

Also I should note that the decision to extend the fabric libraries by 
additional target mode specific routines is a very bad move. I already 
covered this topic in http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/10/245. In short, 
SCSI initiator and target sides share nearly nothing in the processing 
code [2], so they should be separated to keep different things 
separately, as a good design practice required, not to heap them 
altogether as it's currently done and you are going to continue. Good 
example of how it is already done is NFS client (fs/nfs/) and server 
(fs/nfsd/), which share only few ACL processing routines in fs/nfs_common/.

Vlad

[1] SCSI initiator and target are a client and a server correspondingly, 
where one is generating requests and parsing responses, another one 
parsing requests and generating responses, so they have very few in 
common. Like apache (server) and links/firefox (client), or sendmail 
(server) and mutt/thunderbird (client).

[2] Initiator and target modes share only (1) constants, (2) low level 
memory processing and mapping routines. Both of them already separated 
out in the headers and the block subsystem. In case if a hardware 
supports both initiator and target modes at the same time, the target 
mode support should be done as an add-on through a set of hooks exported 
by the corresponding initiator module for the hardware to allow the 
target add-on to process target mode commands from the hardware. This 
way code for both modes would be clearly separated and it would allow to 
load the target mode add-on only when it is needed.
