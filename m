We can't expose the ll/sc model directly, due to various target-specific
hardware constraints (e.g. no other memory references, i.e. no spills).
But the "weak" compare-exchange is sorta-kinda close.

A "weak" compare-exchange is a ll/sc pair, without the loop for restart
on sc failure.  Thus a weak compare-exchange can fail for arbitrary reasons.
You do, however, get back the current value in the memory, so you can loop
back yourself and try again.

So that loop above becomes the familiar expression as for CAS:

  r = *m;
  do {
    if (r == value)
      return;
    n = r + inc;
  } while (!atomic_compare_exchange(m, &r, n, /*weak=*/true,
				    __ATOMIC_RELAXED, __ATOMIC_RELAXED));

which, unlike with the current __sync_val_compare_and_swap, does not
result in a nested loop for the ll/sc architectures.

Yes, the ll/sc architectures can technically do slightly better by writing
this as inline asm, but the gain is significantly less than before.  Given
that the line must be in L1 cache already, the redundant load from M in
the ll insn should be nearly negligible.

Of course for architectures that implement cas, there is no difference
between "weak" and "strong".
