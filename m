TuxOnIce has the following logic at the moment: Freeze all threads.
Calculate whether we have enough memory for the image, thaw kernel
threads only, free memory and try again if it looks like we don't have
enough. I've never heard of a deadlock, though I suppose one would be
possible if you had the added complication of userspace
drivers/filesystems - it would be good to be able to distinguish and
thaw them.

It does this prior to the atomic copy, using a user-supplied estimate of
the amount of memory drivers will need - the actual amount used is show
in debugging info at the end of the cycle. Apart from that, if you have
everything else frozen, everything else is pretty deterministic
(assuming you don't have any memory leaks in your image-writing code).
