Designing a general filter facility which can be used to restrict any container to the subset of system calls it actually needs would make more sense, no?

The "newer versions of seccomp" are NAK'ed by Ingo.  AFAIU, Ingo wants
more generic filters to filter much more than syscalls.  But it
contradicts the security by simplicity, which we're trying to achieve
with this patch.

Compatibility syscalls are much more error prone than common syscalls
as they lack good testing or sometimes lack it at all, unfortunately.
The link I've posted is about a crazy bug - a completely uninitialized
structure was used in copy_from_user() function.  The function was not
tested _at all_.  I doubt any non-compatibility syscall (ioctl()
handler, etc.) can be completely untested.

Also we already have CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION, this patch only moves the
configuration mechanism from the compilation stage to the runtime stage,
it doesn't draw the new line.  It grants the permissions to use the
feature to some containers, but denies to other containers, which is an
rather expected property of containers separation.

Thanks,
