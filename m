That sounds ideal, since you don't have to manage it in the block layer
then.

Lin, you should just use that. My suggestion was that you add the timer
when the queue first goes idle, IFF it isn't already running. When it
expires, you check last activity and decide whether to suspend it or
reset the timer. This is a more optimal than continually adding and
deleting timers, or even just moving it forwards 20s all the time. But
if pm already has support for this type of functionality (and it does,
Alan says, which makes sense since this mechanism would be useful for
other edvices), then you should indeed just use that.
