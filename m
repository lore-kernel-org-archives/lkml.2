Um... now I see that cc'ing LKML was a mistake:

This isn't about adding Linux functionality to a proprietary driver.

It is about the fact that:

1)
Linux's scsi_dh* adds additional SCSI sense processing that conflicts
with processing that a long established competing proprietary driver
also does (and did long before scsi_dh* was introduced).

2)
If Linux is masking SCSI sense that Powerpath needs to see in order to
function then they need a way to shut off that conflicting functionality
in Linux.  What they have enjoyed until now is that Linux has treated
them with kid gloves -- by not always attaching scsi_dh to each SCSI
device during SCSI device scan.

Well it is now time to put Linux (and Linux multipathing) first!  But
doing so while exposing an interface that allows Linux to not have to
make compromises about how good it can be.

I think you're blinded by some innate violent pain reaction to seeing
s/EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL/EXPORT_SYMBOL/

As I said in the header, Linux's ability to properly support scanning
LUNs with multiple paths has been fragile for _years_ purely because we
never had the balls to always attach the scsi_dh which enables Linux to
work well.  We didn't because of fear that we'd break PowerPath.

As a result, Linux has suffered (in the form of reduced functionality).
Now your arguing that the because scsi_dh_detach() will become
EXPORT_SYMBOL it somehow makes PowerPath a derived work if they were to
use it?!? -- even though they clearly cannot use scsi_dh* in their
non-GPL driver because all the other scsi_dh* interfaces (like
scsi_dh_attach!) are _GPL?

The two other people (scsi_dh maintainers) that Acked-by this change
work for companies other than EMC.  James is the SCSI maintainer and
understands what is going on here.  Like me, they are domain experts.

What are you?  You're not a lawyer, you're also clearly uninformed.  So
why even weigh in on something if you cannot understand what the hell is
being proposed?

You're being a troll... sad really.
