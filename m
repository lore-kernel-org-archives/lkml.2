TCM_Loop and scst_local are exactly comparable and do absolutely the 
same thing. If you see any difference, please be precise. Internal 
implementation doesn't matter as soon as it doesn't affect the 
functionality STGT uses.

All those can be done for STGT. LIO isn't needed for that. So, value for 
STGT users still not questionable to me.
