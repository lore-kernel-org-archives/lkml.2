So, kswapd is still looping in reclaim and spending a lot of time in
shrink_slab but it must not be the shrinker itself or that debug patch
would have triggered. It's curious that cgroups are involved with
systemd considering that one would expect those groups to be fairly
small. I still don't have a new theory but will get hold of a Fedora 15
install CD and see can I reproduce it locally.

One last thing, what is the value of /proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode? Two
of the reporting machines could be NUMA and if that proc file reads as
1, I'd be interested in hearing the results of a test with it set to 0.
Thanks.
