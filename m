Agreed with the fact that 400k isn't much to worry about.

Not agreed with the GFP_ATOMIC stmt.

Direct reclaim already has PF_MEMALLOC, but then we also need a
concurrency limit on that, otherwise you can still easily blow though
your reserves by having 100 concurrency users of it, resulting in an
upper bound of 40000k instead, which will be too much.

There were patches to limit the direct reclaim contexts, not sure they
ever got anywhere..

It is something to consider in the re-design of the whole
direct-reclaim/writeback paths though..
