You are thinking of the KABI. That changes per each release except if you buy 
a vendor product. Red Hat for example keeps an KABI symbol list where they 
guarantee that those parameters, structures ,etc will never change. John 
Masters wrote a nice paper about how they solved this:
http://dup.et.redhat.com/presentations/DriverUpdateProgramTechnical.pdf

I don't have experience with other vendors.

In terms of ABI, think ioctl calls and its a parameters. They are suppose to 
stay the same for long long durations.
