No problem, thanks to you for your patience.

If task was created in an ancestor pid namespace of the checkpointed contai=
ner,
I call it foreign and I don't think that we want to checkpoint it together =
with
the container.

Agreed. As long as both of those namespaces are descendant of the container=
's
root pid namespace.

I did not notice any (convincing) argument in favor of changing
ns_of_pid(task_pid(task)) (aka task_active_pid_ns(task)), and I like how Er=
ic's
proposal is simple to implement. But I agree with you that pid namespaces
handling should not be re-worked before a more definitive approach is
implemented.

Thanks,

Louis
