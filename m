Right now I'm faking it with modprobe scsi_debug ato=1 guard=1 dif=3 dix=199.

Hm, would you mind sharing those patches?  I've been working on a second patch
to do the wait-on-writeback per everyone's suggestions, but I still see the
occasional corruption error as soon as I enable the mmap write case and covet
some more debugging tools.  It does seem to be working for the pure pwrite()
case. :)
