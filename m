Yes, change that testcase to run -a 4096 and it will run fine.  Because BTRFS
doesn't pass in a bdev to __blockdev_direct_IO it doesn't do 512 byte aligned
IO, just blocksize aligned IO.  I will fix that at some later point, but its a
little tricky since we have to figure out which bdev has the largest alignment
(in case we have a 4k sector device and a 512 byte sector device in the same
volume).  Thanks,

Josef
