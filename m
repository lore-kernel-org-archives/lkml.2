Oops, sorry, you are correct.

That makes sense to a point, users will wonder why they aren't seeing
interrupts anymore, which is a valuable debug tool.

All that is leaking here is the number of keystrokes at most, right?

Yes, not good.

If we provide a "good" library function for keyboard password usage, we
could get other applications to use it, but yes, it is a tough issue :(
