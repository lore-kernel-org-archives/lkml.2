Obviously the cifs and SMB2 protocols which  Samba server support can
ask the server to set the create time of a file (this is handled
through xattrs today along with the "dos attribute" flags such as
archive/hidden/system), but certainly it is much more common (and
important) to read the creation time of an existing file.

It is another syscall that Samba server would have to make - and xattr
performance is extremely slow on some file systems (although
presumably this one would be more likely to be stored in inode and
perhaps not as bad on ext4, cifs and a few others such as ntfs).
