I was mostly thinking about dm/md, drdb and stuff, but you're talking
about filesystem conversion patches being routed through block tree,
right?

I might just resequence it to finish this part of discussion but what
does that really buy us?  It's not really gonna help bisection.
Bisection won't be able to tell anything in higher resolution than
"the new implementation doesn't work".  If you show me how it would
actually help, I'll happily reshuffle the patches.

IIUC, when any of flushes get DM_ENDIO_REQUEUE (which tells the dm
core layer to retry the whole bio later), it trumps all other failures
and the bio is retried later.  That was why DM_ENDIO_REQUEUE was
prioritized over other error codes, which actually is sort of
incorrect in that once a FLUSH fails, it _MUST_ be reported to upper
layers as FLUSH failure implies data already lost.  So,
DM_ENDIO_REQUEUE actually should have lower priority than other
failures.  But, then again, the error codes still need to be
prioritized.

Yeah, it would be better if it can be sequenced w/o using a work but
let's leave it for later.

Thanks.
