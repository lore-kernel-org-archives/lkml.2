You've stated this many times, but never actually given an explanation
of why.

This isn't the correct way to look at it.  The choice isn't all in
userspace or all in kernel space.  For performance, the key idea is to
have all the fast paths in kernel space.  However, login is hardly a
fast path.  It's done once at start of day, then occasionally on
connection reset.

Moving some code to userspace doesn't mean all has to move.

So what I hear you say is that the login process has to be in-kernel
because otherwise we can't control it from configfs.

I don't think this to be true: you can still have a configfs based
control plane and just do user space upcalls for the pieces that aren't
in-kernel.  I agree with the goal of single control plane, but if
configfs is causing us to be inflexible, I think configfs, rather than
the design, needs to change.

I really don't see this.  The broad abstract state machine looks like


|Target Configuration and initialisation|
   |
   |      +----------------------------- (relogin)
   V      V                            |
|Login (userspace)| ----> |Operation (Kernel)| -> |Termination|

That's nicely separable and doesn't really involve state
synchronisation.  Nothing really says that Termination has to be in
userspace (or kernel space).
