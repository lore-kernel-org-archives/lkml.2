Ok, but again, that only applies to the lookup. It has no bearing on
the subsequent operation. For instance, if we're doing:

     rename("/foo", "/bar");

...and another client is simultaneously doing:

     creat("/bar/baz", 0600);

...and we get back ESTALE from the server on the create because the
"old" /bar got replaced after the lookup of it. Then it seems like
returning -ENOENT would not be correct since there was never a time
where /bar didn't exist...

It might eventually be nice to add that optimization to the path lookup
code. OTOH, it only solves a very specific problem that's not really
applicable in a lot of the cases I'm interested in fixing.
