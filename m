That's probably a bug, but I haven't sat down to work through the logic.

There are many ways to do this...

In general, it's difficult to get locking right, especially when you
start mixing multiple locks on related resources. Personally, I'd go
with a simpler scheme here. There's not much value in protecting this
counter with a spinlock when the other parts need to be protected by a
mutex. If you do decide to do it with multiple locks, then please do
document in comments how the locking is expected to work. 

An alternate scheme might be to consider doing this with krefs, but I
haven't really considered whether that idiom makes sense here.
