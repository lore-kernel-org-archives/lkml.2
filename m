I'm trying to reproduce it with that patch. but, It is unlikely to be fixed.
because scsi_run_queue is invoked from scsi_requeue_run_queue,
not scsi_requeue_command.

yes, extra reference is not good to fix.
But, As long as scsi_device_dev_release_usercontext set request_queue
to NULL, Isn't it necessary to ensure that __blk_run_queue don't release device?

Thanks a lot!
