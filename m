This all seems highly specific to one particular set of requirements. 
We have one set of access permission rules and then dive into procfs
and hard-wire those rules into the implementation?  What happens if
someone else has a similar but slightly different set of requirements? 
More kernel patches?

IOW is there some more general way of doing all this?  <handwaving>Like
better permissions/chmod support in procfs and an inherited-across-fork
per-process procfs permissions mask.</handwaving>


Does all this code support `mount -o remount' as expected?
