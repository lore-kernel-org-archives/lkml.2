Deterministic TRIM is an option.  It doesn't have to be implemented.
And as you even pointed out, there are ways of doing this
intelligently.  Whether "intelligently" and "drive firmware authors"
are two phrases that should be used in the same sentence is a concern
that I will grant, but that's why mount -o discard is not the default.

Says who?  We've deleted files on hard drives for a long time without
scrubbing data blocks.  Why should a non-deterministic trim be any
different.  If the goal is a better performing SSD, and not security,
then non-deterministic trim should definitely _not_ ensure that the
original data is no longer accessible.
