Thank you for testing and the report.

Since scsi_free_queue() frees elevator, calling it while there
still is a user of the elevator has no way to work.
Either we should call it later (like the above suggestion)
or change scsi_free_queue not to free the elevator
(James posted a patch early in this thread).

I think the latter approach could be nice if it worked.
But if not, the former approach should be taken.
Without fix, a path failure can cause a panic. This is bad...
