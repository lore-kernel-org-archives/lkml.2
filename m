I've uploaded a trace output that includes the sysrq-t trace, but I
don't think it shows anything interesting.  We're not hanging on any
kind of loack as near as I can tell.  It looks like
__generic_make_request() is calling q->make_request_fn(), and this is
returning without actually doing anything.

http://userweb.kernel.org/~tytso/ext4-bio-patches/kvm-console-2

In this trace, I added a patch to prove that __generic_make_request()
is calling __make_request (I wasn't sure what q->make_request_fn was
indirecting to, so I added a brute force lookup to make sure I
understood what was going on), but at one point, it just starts
queuing the request, and it enters cfq, but the request never gets
dispatched out.  Maybe this is a failure of the plugging/unplugging
mechanisms?

I guess I can start putting in more brute-force printk's inside
__make_request and inside the cfq scheduler to try to understand what
is going on, but I'm really guessing at this point.

If you have any suggestions about more elegant ways of figuring what
is happening, please do let me know....
