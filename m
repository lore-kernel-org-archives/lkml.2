I would have to say I think native endian is probably the sane thing 
still, out of several bad alternatives.  Certainly splitting the high 
and low halves of arguments is insane.

The other thing that you really need in addition to system call number 
is ABI identifier, since a syscall number may mean different things for 
different entry points.  For example, on x86-64 system call number 4 is 
write() if called via int $0x80 but stat() if called via syscall64. 
This is a local property of the system call, not a global per process.
