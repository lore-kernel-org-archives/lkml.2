Dave,

Coule of thoughts.

- We can introduce anohter block layer call were dependencies are setup
  from worker thread context. So when the process schedules the work, it can
  save the task information somewhere and when the worker thread actually
  calls the specified funciton, that function can setup the dependency
  between worker thread and submitting task.

  Probably original process can tear down the dependency connection
  when IO is done. I am assuming that IO submitting process is waiting
  for all IO to finish.

  In current framework one can specify multiple processes being dependent
  on one thread but not vice-a-versa. I think we should be able to 
  handle that by maintaining a linked list of dependent queues instead
  of single pointer. So if a process submits a bunch of jobs with help
  of bunch of worker threads from multiple cpus, I think that case is
  manageable with some extension to current patches.

- Or we can also try to do something more exotic and that when we schedule
  a work, one should be able to tell which cgroup the worker should run in.
  When the worker actually runs, it can migrate itself to destination
  destination cgroup and submit IO. This does not take care of cases like
  journalling thread where multiple processes are dependent on single
  kernel thread. In that case above dependent queue solution should work
  well.

So I think above API can be extended to handle the case of work queues
also or we could look into migrating worker in user specified cgroup if
that turns out to be a better solution. 

Thanks
Vivek
