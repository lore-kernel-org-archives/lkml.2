Hi Jim,
Due to BFA_FCS_PORT_SYMBNAME_MODEL_SZ macro value of 12, we are missing some part of the model name in port/node symbolic name and seeing issues related to null termination. Mismatch between the actual model size and number of bytes copied to symbolic name is a bug. Can you please fix this by changing BFA_FCS_PORT_SYMBNAME_MODEL_SZ  to 16 and reduce os_name macro (BFA_FCS_PORT_SYMBNAME_OSINFO_SZ) to 44, so that both the issues i.e symbolic name and null termination will be fixed.

Thanks,
Vijay

Taking Andi's advice, I've made the offending code use strlcpy in place of strncpy.  More importantly, I've fixed the same bug also in the following, nearly identical function.

Two functions have this problem:
  bfa_fcs_fabric_psymb_init
  bfa_fcs_fabric_nsymb_init
They use strncpy to copy a model name of length up to 15 (16, if you count the NUL), into a buffer of size 12 (BFA_FCS_PORT_SYMBNAME_MODEL_SZ).
However, strncpy does not always NUL-terminate, so whenever the original model string has strlen >= 12, the following strncat reads beyond end of the ->sym_name buffer as it attempts to find end of string.
Instead, use strlcpy, which does guarantee NUL-termination.

bfa_fcs_fabric_psymb_init(struct bfa_fcs_fabric_s *fabric) {
	bfa_ioc_get_adapter_model(&fabric->fcs->bfa->ioc, model);
	...
	strncpy((char *)&port_cfg->sym_name, model,
		BFA_FCS_PORT_SYMBNAME_MODEL_SZ);
	strncat((char *)&port_cfg->sym_name, BFA_FCS_PORT_SYMBNAME_SEPARATOR,
		sizeof(BFA_FCS_PORT_SYMBNAME_SEPARATOR));
	...

bfa_ioc_get_adapter_model(struct bfa_ioc_s *ioc, char *model) {
	struct bfi_ioc_attr_s	*ioc_attr;

	WARN_ON(!model);
	memset((void *)model, 0, BFA_ADAPTER_MODEL_NAME_LEN);

BFA_ADAPTER_MODEL_NAME_LEN = 16
