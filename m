That's right. Or you can mount it with -o noinit_itable to prevent
kernel from initializing the inode table. But I would expect that this
will not have such a huge impact since it is done in both w/ and w/o
case.

There is logic in the uninitialized extent handling that will write zeros to an entire extent, rather than create many fragmented uninitialized extents.  It may be possible that you are zeroing out the entire file, and writing 16x as much data as you expect.
