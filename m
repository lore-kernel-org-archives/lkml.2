Tang,

Good catch!

The above changelog could show a bit more details (to help me
understand it :).

Does it happen frequently and hence has measurable overheads?

Is it safe to skip the inode? Another alternative is to wait for it:
with inode_wait_for_writeback(inode).

Comments should go above the whole code block. And the above comment
does not really say anything. Say something *why* code like this
rather than *what* the code is doing.
