Wrong! Not if we _know_ that the mtime was updated due to an action we
took. We don't have to invalidate the lookup cache every time we create
a new dentry: we're quite able to add that dentry in to the cache
ourselves, and we do that.

The current code is not wrong.

So why is it going through the wcc case, and why does wcc think that the
client created the file?

Changing the wcc behaviour won't fix this.

Then you need to explain why. As I said, the wcc code path should not be
triggered when the client isn't creating or deleting stuff in the
directory. The WCC is there to tell you that your client and only your
client has changed stuff in the directory since it last revalidated the
mtime.

I disagree.

I can't take the patch as it stands. It is obviously wrong whether or
not it fixes your test case.

I'm happy to accept that there may be a bug, but you're going to have to
investigate further what is happening, and figure out why changing the
WCC code appears to fix the situation.
My hunch is that you are seeing a server bug rather than a client bug
here...
