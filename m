	I wish you'd mentioned the oops earlier.  We need to figure out
who is oopsing.

	I think you have too many ../ on your examples.  dst_link
pointing to ../../../../group1/src_0 resolves to
/sys/kernel/config/group1/src_0, which I don't think you want.  I think
you have:

    sub_parent/group1/parent
    sub_child/group1/src_0/src_link -> ../../../sub_parent/group1/parent
    sub_child/group2/dst_0/dst_link -> ../../group1/src_0

	If I'm reading this right, 'ls sub_child/group1/src_0/src_link'
gives you the contents of sub_parent/group1/parent, 'ls
sub_child/group2/dst_0/dst_link' gives you 'src_link', and 'ls
sub_child/group2/dst_0/dst_link/src_link' brings you right back to the
contents of sub_parent/group1/parent.  Am I right?

	I'm confused.  Above it appears that
sub_child/group2/dst_0/dst_link -> ../../group1/src_0, but this
paragraph suggests that sub_child/group2/dst_0/dst_link ->
../../group1/src_0/src_link.  Which is it?

	My big question is whether the oops comes from something
configfs is doing wrong when symlinking symlinks, or if your module is
just surprised when things change.  If the former, it needs to be fixed
in configfs.  It shouldn't require a hook for your module to avoid
configfs breakage.  If it is the latter, and your module needs to know
not to break itself, then we discuss how to help it.
