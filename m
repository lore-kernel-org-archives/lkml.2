I will convert mem_cgroup_iter to use this rather than css_get_next
after this gets into the next tree so that it can fly via Andrew.

Reviewed-by: Michal Hocko <mhocko@suse.cz>

Just a minor knit. You are talking about a config propagation while I
would consider state propagation more clear and less confusing. Config
is usually stable enough so that post_create is not necessary for
syncing (e.g. memcg.swappiness). It is a state which must be consistent
throughout the hierarchy which matters here.

Thanks!
