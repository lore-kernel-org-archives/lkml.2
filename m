Right.

It is not obvious to me that this is unintended, and that dealing with
it in some way makes much of a difference.  (Also, it's not exactly "any
other process owned by the same user" - this only affects processes that
also run with similar or lower RLIMIT_NPROC.  So, for example, if a web
server is set to use RLIMIT_NPROC of 30, but interactive logins use 40,
then the latter may succeed and allow for shell commands to succeed.
This is actually a common combination of settings that we've been using
on some systems for years.)

That's a curious idea, and apparently this is what NetBSD does, but
unfortunately it does not match a common use case that we are interested
in - specifically, Apache with suEXEC (which is part of the Apache
distribution).  Here's what happens:

httpd runs as non-root.  It forks, execs suexec (SUID root).  suexec
calls setuid() to the target non-root user and execve() on the CGI
program (script, interpreter, whatever).

Notice how the fork() and the setuid() are separated by execve() of
suexec itself.  Thus, we need to apply the RLIMIT_NPROC check on
execve() unconditionally (well, we may allow processes with
CAP_SYS_RESOURCE to proceed despite of the failed check, like it's
done in -ow patches), or at least not on the condition proposed above.
