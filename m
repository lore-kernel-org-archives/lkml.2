Hi Linus,

Please also pull from the "pnfs-submit" branch of the repository at

   git pull git://git.open-osd.org/linux-open-osd.git pnfs-submit

This set of changes contains bugfixes for the existing pnfs "files"
target, and also adds support for the "objects" pnfs target (as detailed
in RFC5664). Although the code is not going through my usual tree, it
has been extensively reviewed by myself and others on the NFS mailing
list for the past 2 months. It makes no functional changes to the
existing NFSv2/v3/v4 client code, but does add some infrastructure to
the existing pNFS code in order to support the new target.

The full set of changes will update the following files through the
appended changesets.

  Cheers,
    Trond

    pnfs-obj: report errors and .encode_layoutreturn Implementation.
    
    An io_state pre-allocates an error information structure for each
    possible osd-device that might error during IO. When IO is done if all
    was well the io_state is freed. (as today). If the I/O has ended with an
    error, the io_state is queued on a per-layout err_list. When eventually
    encode_layoutreturn() is called, each error is properly encoded on the
    XDR buffer and only then the io_state is removed from err_list and
    de-allocated.
    
    It is up to the io_engine to fill in the segment that fault and the type
    of osd_error that occurred. By calling objlayout_io_set_result() for
    each failing device.
    
    In objio_osd:
    * Allocate io-error descriptors space as part of io_state
    * Use generic objlayout error reporting at end of io.

    pnfs: layoutret_on_setattr
    
    With the objects layout security model, we have object capabilities
    that are associated with the layout and we anticipate that the server
    will issue a cb_layoutrecall for any setattr that changes security
    related attributes (user/group/mode/acl) or truncates the file.
    
    Therefore, the layout is returned before issuing the setattr to avoid
    the anticipated cb_layoutrecall.

    pnfs: client stats
    
    A pNFS client auto-negotiates a lot of features (minorversion level,
    pNFS layout type, etc.).  This is convenient, but makes certain kinds of
    failures hard for a user to detect.
    
    For example, if the client falls back on 4.0, or falls back to MDS IO
    because the user didn't connect to the right iscsi disks before
    mounting, the only symptoms may be reduced performance, which may not be
    noticed till long after the actual failure, and may be difficult for a
    user to diagnose.
    
    However, such "failures" may also be perfectly normal in some cases, so
    we don't want to spam the system logs with them.
    
    One approach would be to put some more information into
    /proc/self/mountstats.

    NFSv4.1: use layout driver in global device cache
    
    pnfs deviceids are unique per server, per layout type.
    struct nfs_client is currently used to distinguish deviceids from
    different nfs servers, yet these may clash between different layout
    types on the same server.  Therefore, use the layout driver associated
    with each deviceid at insertion time to look it up, unhash, or
    delete it.

    NFSv4.1: use struct nfs_client to qualify deviceid
    
    deviceids are unique per server, per layout type.
    Therefore, in the global cache in the files layout driver
    deviceids from different servers may clash so we need
    to qualify them with a struct nfs_client that represents
    the nfs server that returned the deviceid.
