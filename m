I think one problem point is q->queue_lock. If driver drops its reference
on queue and cleans up its data structures, then it will free up memory
associated with q->queue_lock too. (If driver provided its own queue
lock). In that case anything which is dependent on queue lock, needs
to be freed up on blk_cleanup_queue().

If we can make sure that request queue reference will keep the spin lock
alive, then i guess all cleanup part might be able to go in release
queue function.
