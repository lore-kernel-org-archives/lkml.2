We already do that. First IO is subjected to throttling limit and only 
then it is passed to the elevator to do the proportional IO. So throttling
is already stacked on top of proportional IO. The only question is 
should it be pushed to even higher layers or not.

Separate limits for buffered writes are just filling the gap. Agreed it
is not a very neat solution.

If we push up all the throttling somewhere in higher layer, say some
of kind of per bdi throttling interface, then elevator just have to
worry about doing proportional IO. No interaction with higher layers
regarding iops/bps etc. (Not that elevator worries about it today).

So split model is definitely confusing. Anyway, block layer will not
apply the limits again as flusher IO will go in root cgroup which 
generally goes to root which is unthrottled generally. Or flusher
could mark the bios with a flag saying "do not throttle" bios again as
these have been throttled already. So throttling again is probably not
an issue. 

In summary, agreed that split is confusing and it fills a gap existing
today.

Thanks
