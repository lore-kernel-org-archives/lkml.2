I just try to find out whether we could using DISABLE with out ONESHOT :)

My currently understanding is:

1. we actually want to determine the part between each epoll_wait() in a
while().

2. we can't count on epoll_wait() itself, since no info pass to kernel
to indicate whether it was invoked after another epoll_wait() in the
same while().

3. so we need epoll_ctl(MOD) to tell kernel: user finished process data
after epoll_wait(), and those data belong to which epi.

4. since 3 we need ONESHOT to be enabled.


Is this the reason we rely on ONESHOT to be enabled?


If it is, then if we could do some change to make epoll_wait() have the
ability:

1. indicate whether it is invoked after another epoll_wait() in same while()

2. indicate which epi has been fired by last epoll_wait()

3. no changes on the api for user

Then we could mark the safe section inside epoll_wait(), and we don't
need MOD or ONESHOT any more, is that correct?

Michael Wang
