I'm currently experimenting with "Judy arrays", which would likely be a
good fit for this kind of use-case.

It's basically a 256-ary trie, with fixed depth that depends on the key
size, that uses various encoding (compaction) schemes to compress
internal nodes depending on their density. The original implementation
made by HP has been criticised as somewhat too complex (20k lines of
code), but I'm currently working (in my spare time) on a more elegant
solution, that supports RCU lookups and distributed locking, and uses
much simpler node compaction schemes, and focus on having good cache
locality (and minimal number of cache line hits) for lookups.

I'll be presenting my ongoing work at Plumbers, if you are interested.

Best regards,

Mathieu
