Hi Santosh, James et all,

I've not seen many comments on these patches. It looks like just a few minor
issues that may need to be resolved. It's probably too late to get this into
3.4, but could we get this pulled into scsi tree's for linux-next  branch once
these issue are resolved? Santosh, do you have a new version of the patches
to post with these updates?

Thanks,
~Deepak
