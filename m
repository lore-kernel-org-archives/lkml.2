BTW, this current version is user namespace aware.

An fs actually seems overkill for two write-only files for
process-related information.  Would these actually be candidates
for new /proc files?

	/proc/grantcred - replaces /dev/caphash, for privileged
		tasks to tell the kernel about new setuid
		capabilities
	/proc/self/usecred - replaces /dev/capuse for unprivileged
		tasks to make use of a setuid capability
