It's as old as BSD, defined by syslog(3), used by glibc. The whole
<%u> prefix notation and the LOG_* names come from there.

The kernel is just user/facility == 0, so it never really was apparent
that the whole concept has more than a log level in that number.

Userspace syslog defines these pretty stupid numbers:
  /* facility codes */
  #define LOG_KERN        (0<<3)  /* kernel messages */
  #define LOG_USER        (1<<3)  /* random user-level messages */
  #define LOG_MAIL        (2<<3)  /* mail system */
  #define LOG_DAEMON      (3<<3)  /* system daemons */
  #define LOG_AUTH        (4<<3)  /* security/authorization messages */
  #define LOG_SYSLOG      (5<<3)  /* messages generated internally by syslogd */
  #define LOG_LPR         (6<<3)  /* line printer subsystem */
  #define LOG_NEWS        (7<<3)  /* network news subsystem */
  #define LOG_UUCP        (8<<3)  /* UUCP subsystem */
  #define LOG_CRON        (9<<3)  /* clock daemon */
  #define LOG_AUTHPRIV    (10<<3) /* security/authorization messages
(private) */
  #define LOG_FTP         (11<<3) /* ftp daemon */

but it *can* still all be pretty useful, and people *can* get creative
with facility numbers if they want to, as we have like 13 bits at the
moment to use for the facility which is stored in the kernel log
buffer. :)

/dev/kmsg just enforces LOG_USER, if userspace tries to inject stuff
with LOG_KERN, which it should not be allowed. The non-LOG_KERN number
itself has not much meaning it just says: "this is not from the
kernel" which is important to keep in the message.

Als, dmesg(1) has a -k option, that filters out all userspace-injected stuff.

Yeah, I think so.

Yeah, we strip the <>  at printk() time, add the <> back at output
time; they are not stored internally anymore, so that should not
affect the current behaviour.

We should make it not accept faked prefixes, yes. It should be
impossible to let messages look like they originated from the kernel,
just like the current code enforces a non-LOG_KERN <> prefix.
