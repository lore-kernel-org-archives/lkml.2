"The speed at which the block write request to the MANAGEMENT_AGENT 
register is received shall determine the speed used by the target for 
all subsequent requests to read the initiator’s configuration ROM, fetch 
ORB’s from initiator memory or store status at the initiator’s 
status_FIFO. Command block ORB’s separately specify the speed for 
requests addressed to the data buffer or page table."

It still tries to and never appears to give up, so this needs 
blacklisting on the target system until firewire_sbp2 is changed. It's 
harmless other than filling up the kernel log with error messages.

What I meant, however, is if you connect to the target from a separate 
Linux system you will be unable to disable the unit on the target system 
until the _initiator_ logs out. You can do this on the initiator by 
unloading the module, which sends a logout request to the target.

HTH,
