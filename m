Intents are vile crap that has been introduced by the nfs folks to start
with...  I've been trying to localize the mess and it's got a _lot_ better
than it used to be a year ago, but they are still not gone.  And yes, I
plan to kill that crap.  Basically, most of the do_last() guts will become
a method that would get struct file *explicitly* and ask the fs to do
(possibly atomic) open.  With normal filesystems defaulting to what's there
right now.

The main obstacle at the moment is in ->d_revalidate() abuses.  NFS, CIFS
*and* autofs, the last one in a way that isn't really compatible with what
NFS et.al. are trying to do.  Overloading of ->d_revalidate() and ->lookup()
to do the work of open() doesn't help, and the horrors nfs4 piles on top
of that are even scarier.

_Another_ fine piece of something is ->follow_link() abuses, including
referrals' treatment.  Also tied to the previous messes.

We definitely will need to get VFS-to-fs APIs in that area changed; most of
the mess has been created by the deeply misguided efforts to keep the API
changes minimal.

As for the flags, quite a few will be gone once we split "opening the final
component" from the normal cases.  Google for lookup_instantiate_filp+shit
for details of these plans...
