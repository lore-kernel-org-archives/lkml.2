We previously tried to use a large flex_bg size to put all metadata into a
single group so it could easily be allocated on a separate SSD device, but
that didn't work very well.  Once the number of bitmaps in group 0 is more
than the number of free blocks in that group (below 16k groups, due to group
descriptors) then they need to overflow into group 1 and collide with the
group descriptors there.  Then mke2fs chokes, AFAIR.

It may be different with bigalloc, since the number of blocks in a group can
be very large, I haven't tried that.

In any case, I don't think anyone expects vmalloc(2^32 * struct size) to work,
but I wouldn't sweat fixing this until there is some real reason to do so.

Cheers, Andreas
