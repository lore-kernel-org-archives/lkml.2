Following the mail is a series of patches to fix a number of FS-Cache problems,
including a number of oopses.  The patches can also be found at:

	http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/dhowells/linux-fscache.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/fixes

The patches are as follows:

 (*) A patch to correctly mark cached netfs pages.  This fixes an oops that
     shows up in the page allocator with PG_private_2 still being set on pages.

 (*) A patch to downgrade memory allocation levels in the cache to not try so
     hard and to be more willing to abort with ENOMEM.  It's a cache - it
     doesn't matter if we can't store something.

 (*) A patch to check that there are no read operations outstanding on a
     cookie when it is relinquished.

 (*) A patch to make conditional some debugging prints.

 (*) A patch to make cookie relinquishment log a warning and wait for any
     outstanding reads.

 (*) A patch to fix up operation state handling and accounting.  This fixes a
     BUG in __fscache_relinquish_cookie() that occurs when cache operation
     completion gets out of sync with the netfs releasing a cookie back to
     fscache.

 (*) Four patches to provide proper invalidation facilities so that the netfs
     can request a cache object be invalidated rather than retiring the cookie
     it has and then getting a new one.

     The first patch provides the hooks and management in the FS-Cache module.

     The second patch splits do_sys_truncate() to create a vfs_truncate() for
     cachefiles's invalidation to call.

     The third patch makes cachefiles honour invalidation requests.

     The fourth patch makes NFS use the invalidation call.

     These fix a BUG() in __fscache_read_or_alloc_pages() that occurs when an
     object that has operations outstanding on it gets its cookie removed.

 (*) Add some missing calls to note completion of retrieval operations in
     cachefiles.  These cause an assertion failure BUG in
     fscache_put_operation() when it tries to destroy an operation that is
     still live.

 (*) Three patches to clean up object event IDs in FS-Cache and to stop masking
     off bits that needn't be masked off.

 (*) A patch to limit the number of I/O errors reported on a cache to 1.  This
     prevents a lot of noise being generated from a busy cache when it is
     aborted.

 (*) A patch to handle an unexpected state in exclusive op submission in
     FS-Cache.  This fixes a BUG that occurs in fscache_submit_exclusive_op()
     if it sees the cache in an aborted state due to an I/O error having
     occurred.

 (*) A patch to make nfs_migrate_page() wait for FS-Cache to finish with a
     page.  This fixes a bad page state BUG in the memory allocator due to NFS
     trying to migrate a page that FS-Cache is doing stuff to.
