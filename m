by storage driver, I mean anything in the writeout path ... this
includes ULDs, of which sg is one.

Well, swap can function above block devices or files.

However, it's not just swap, it's also triggerable via mmap (you do file
backed mmap of a large area then have a process that joyfully dirties
lots of it) ... and that's what can make it such a difficult problem.
Basically you end up with a system with mostly dirty memory that it has
to clean via writeout (either to swap or by flushing dirty pages).  The
writeout path that these pages go down cannot ever wait on dirty pages
being flushed (which is what a sleeping kmalloc does), because that can
end up as a deadlock.

It can ... my point was that the assumption that just because the user
copy can sleep on a page fault doesn't mean that the kmalloc can
(although it seems obvious that it should, and that's the trap).

if exofs is GFP_KERNEL, it can get into the same issue if users can mmap
large memory areas over exofs files ... or if exofs supports swap files.

Possibly ... although this is a parameter area, the chances of losing it
between setting it up and calling sg_write are pretty small.
