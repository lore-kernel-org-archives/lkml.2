The use case I'm looking at is concurrent fsyncs on /different/ inodes,
actually.  We have _n_ different processes, each writing (and fsyncing) its own
separate file on the same filesystem.

iirc, ext4_sync_file is called with the inode mutex held, which prevents
concurrent fsyncs on the same inode.

So I hacked up a patch to the block layer that collects measurements of the
time delay between blk_start_request and blk_finish_request when a flush
command is encountered, and what I noticed was that there's a rather large
discrepancy between the delay as observed by the block layer and the delay as
observed by ext4.  In general, the discrepancy is a nearly 2x increase between
what the block layer sees and what ext4 sees, so I'll give Christoph's
direct-flush patch (below) a try over the weekend.
