So the translation is that there's a possibility it will crash USB
devices but the only way to find out is to release it and see.

My problem is that it only takes one bug report from one failing device
(which I'm sure some kind soul will dig out of the attic or wherever
they threw it) for this to be a regression and then I get to revert the
patch ... unless we have a working backup plan?

I think it's easy to put in and easy to revert ... we'll pick up a bit
of flack if the failing device doesn't appear for some time, but I'm OK
with risking that.
