This is the question is what in-container root is :-)  Until LXC root is
restricted up to the case where he is unable to get out of the container
in the mainline kernel, I assume we're talking about an abstract entity
which has full control over the container.  It includes stuff like
CAP_CHOWN, CAP_KILL, CAP_SYS_PTRACE, CAP_NET_ADMIN, etc. etc.  The
debatable thing is what parts of CAP_SYS_ADMIN belong to in-container
root, like ability to mount/umount.  But CAP_SYS_PTRACE is surely
belongs to the in-container root.

Probably we need strict rules like ptrace is relaxed iff in both source
ns and dest ns ptrace is relaxed.

We have already very big net_namespace with all kind of per-ns stuff.
Yama's variables don't significantly increase the size of container.


Actually, what concerns me is not ptrace, but symlink/hardling
protection.  There is no interaction between namespaces in case of
containers via symlinks in the basic case.  In case of ptrace I don't
think the child ns may weaken the parent ns - child ns may not access
processes of the parent namespace and everything it may ptrace is
already inside of this ns.
