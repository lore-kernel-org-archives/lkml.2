Indeed we have not. But speaking of benchmarks I have just finished
quick run (well, not so quick:)) of my discard-kit for btrfs filesystem
and here are results. Note that tool used for this benchmark is
postmark, hence it might not be the realest use-case, but it provides
nice comparison between ext4 (below) and btrfs online discard
implementation (FITRIM is NOT involved).


(Sadly the table is too wide so you have to...well, you guys can manage
it somehow, right?).

(Buffering means that C library function like fopen, fread, fwrite are
used instead of open, read, write. I have used the word buffering in the
same way as it is used in the postmark test)

So, you can see that Btrfs handles online discard quite better than ext4
(cca 20% difference), but it is still pretty massive performance loss on
not-so-good-but-I-have-seen-worse SSD. So, I would say that you guys
(Josef?) should at least consider the possibility of using FITRIM as well.

Thanks!
