That's the point ... it's purely for operations which require user
context which may not have it.  There's no synchronisation by design
(it's a simple API).

The open coding of if (in_atomic()) { do workqueue stuff } else
{ execute function } is rather bug prone (most people tend to do
in_interrupt()).  It's better to encapsulate it in an API.

It was in SCSI ... I got told to make it generic.
