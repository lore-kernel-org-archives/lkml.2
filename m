Seems that scsi-ml calls scsi_unprep_request() for not-prepped
requests in scsi_init_io error path. So we could move that
scsi_unprep_request() to the error path in scsi_prep_return(). Then we
can free discard page in the single place.

Applying the rule strictly is fine by me too; we remove
scsi_unprep_request() in scsi_init_io error path and clean up things
in each prep function's error path.


Btw, blk_clear_request_payload() is necessary?

Making sure that a request is clean is not a bad idea but if we hit
BLKPREP_KILL or BLKPREP_DEFER, we call
blk_end_request(). blk_end_request() can free a request properly even
if we don't do something like blk_clear_request_payload?
