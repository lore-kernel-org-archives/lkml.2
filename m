My take on this in short again:
The very same thing that needs to store the 'pretty name' in the
kernel here, can instead just log that name along with the kernel name
to /dev/kmsg. It ends up in the kernel log buffer and is the marker to
safely match all later log entries.

This can be done today, even on many years old distros, with a single
udev rule and a tiny program. It needs no kernel or tool changes and
gives almost all the benefits of the 'pretty name' infrastructure.
