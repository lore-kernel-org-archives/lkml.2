Personally, i am really like Linux, and use it since 1990. :-)
I have set up about 30 servers or more...
Usually i can't use the distro-release kernels, because these usually too 
old.
Additionally i can find bugs on any software and in any kernel version.... 
B-)
This is not the first time when i report bugs from the kernel, maybe the 4th 
or 5th time...
(I was who helped to solve the original NBD deadlock problem as well about 
2005.)

Anyway, thanks for your suggestion. ;-)

Cheers,
Janos
