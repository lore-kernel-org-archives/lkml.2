I have a confusion to this, can you please guide where exactly to look for this.
Is there any existing solution to this problem? I did a lot of
analysis and actually tried to make use of a number of USB HDD's from
different vendors to be very sure of my observations. Our's is a
target where-in we connect our HDD through the USB interface.
Do you mean that putting code changes at this place would have impact
on SATA HDD?
Please help more on this.

Again, if possible please share that code point, We can again check if
that is hitting in our case.
If need be I can provide the list of all the HDDs with their
manufaturer ID's - on which we tested.
Please let me know for this.
