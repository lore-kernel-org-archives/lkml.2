I'm not saying its free, I'm saying its a much better approach since it
gets rid of the entire problem instead of papering over the worst of it.

So that individual applications can provide their timing tolerance and
the OS can group these timers in order to optimize idle time or whatnot.

Indiscriminately changing the slack for a whole group of otherwise
unrelated applications will violate their timing tolerances and break
them in non-obvious ways.


  
What I'm saying is that its much better to attack the primary source of
evil in a manner that is unforgiving instead of trying to avoid the
worst excesses and cause non-obvious breakage.

For a while people were promoting the idea that its good to be lenient
in what you accept as input and strict in what you send out. I think
people are starting to realize that was a horrid mistake since now
they're getting utter crap and people don't even know what right is
anymore.
