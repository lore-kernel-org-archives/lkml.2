Make arch/ia64/include/asm/kvm_para.h generic since it's the same as the
asm-generic version.  This deals with the problem when ia64 is compiled with
allmodconfig you get:

In file included from include/uapi/linux/kvm_para.h:26:0,
                 from include/linux/kvm_para.h:4,
                 from kernel/watchdog.c:28:
arch/ia64/include/asm/kvm_para.h:24:28: error: redefinition of 'kvm_arch_para_features'
include/asm-generic/kvm_para.h:16:28: note: previous definition of 'kvm_arch_para_features' was here
arch/ia64/include/asm/kvm_para.h:29:20: error: redefinition of 'kvm_check_and_clear_guest_paused'
include/asm-generic/kvm_para.h:11:20: note: previous definition of 'kvm_check_and_clear_guest_paused' was here

This does not happen for ia64 defconfig.
