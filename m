hmm... My understanding is ext3/4 implementation of fsync syncing the
whole filesystem, as a jbd2 transacation could including metadata update
from other files, jbd2 has to commit the latest transactions.  But the
caller is fsync(), which should only need to ensure the specified
inode's dirty data/metadata gets to disk by sending barriers down.
