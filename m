Record the current temperature in the frequency data, and if it
changes, change the list it is on.

Yes, but a hot_inode_item or hot_range_item can only have one
location in the heat map, right? So it doesn't need external
structure to point to the frequency data to track this....

Right - but that data is only extracted after an initial
hot_inode_tree lookup - The heat map itself is never directly used
for lookups. If it's not used for lookups based on temperature, why
is it needed?
