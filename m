Did you use the fs_mark command line I (think I) had posted?  What
storage were you using?

I took Vivek's iostest and modified the mixed workload to do buffered
random reader, buffered sequential reader, and buffered writer for all
of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 threads each.

The initial problem was reported against iozone, which can show the
problem quite easily when run like so:
  iozone -s 64 -e -f /mnt/test/iozone.0 -i 0 -+n

You can also just run iozone in auto mode, but that can take quite a
while to complete.

All of my tests for this round have been against a NetApp hardware
RAID.  I wanted to test against a simple sata disk as well, but have
become swamped with other issues.

I'll include all of this information in the next patch posting.  Sorry
about that.

Cheers,
Jeff
