Compiling aic94xx_sds.o (part of the aic94xx driver) triggers this GCC
warning:
    drivers/scsi/aic94xx/aic94xx_sds.c: In function 'asd_read_flash':
    drivers/scsi/aic94xx/aic94xx_sds.c:597:21: warning: 'offs' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
    drivers/scsi/aic94xx/aic94xx_sds.c:985:6: note: 'offs' was declared here

This warning can be traced back to asd_find_flash_de(). If it fails to
find a FLASH_DE_CTRL_A_USER entry it will return without setting 'offs'.
And that will leave 'offs' uninitialized when asd_read_flash_seg() is
called a little later.

But that call of asd_read_flash_seg() isn't needed in that case.
Everything this code cares about can already be found in the "default
CTRL-A user settings section" that was created in the error path. So
let's just jump over that call (and all other unneeded code) after
creating that section.

0) I noticed this warning while building v3.6-rc7 on current Fedora
17, using Fedora's default config.

1) Compile tested only. It might be best to run test this too, if only
to test whether the non-error path is unaffected.

2) This piece of code has not been touched ever since it was added in
v2.6.19, with commit 2908d778ab3e244900c310974e1fc1c69066e450 ("[SCSI]
aic94xx: new driver"). So, given the current code, chances are that a
"CTRL-A user settings section" is always present and the code to create
a default section might as well be dropped. So perhaps a more drastic
patch is preferable.
