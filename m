At least 2 and 3 list, just not as global patches against the
target tree, not ib_srpt specificly:

2 is from: [PATCH] target: header reshuffle, part2
3 is from: [PATCH 5/5] target: check hex2bin result

Not sure about 1.

I'm really getting tired of this bickering. It's a brand new driver and
doesn't have to be perfect.  While Bart generally has technically good
points there's really no reason to put his remaining fixups in after
the driver has been merged and available to a wieder audience.
