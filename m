Can't blame anyone for assuming as much (although it does create FUD)
but in practice (testing dm-crypt with ext4 using your barrier-test
script) I have not been able to see any evidence that dm-crypt's barrier
support is ineffective.

Could be that the barrier-test script isn't able to reproduce the unique
failure case that btrfs does (on power failure)?

I still think we need specific bug reports that detail workloads and if
possible reproducers.

I started with ext4 + barrier=0,journal_async_commit and could reliably
cause directory corruption (~75% of the time).  I then switched to
barrier=1 and could not cause corruption.

I then added dm-crypt and got the same results: with barrier=1 I could
not cause directory corruption.  barrier=0 resulted in directory
corruption (again ~75% of the time), no corruption occurred with
barrier=1.

Both 2.6.36 (original barrier code) and latest 2.6.37-rc1+ (new
flush+fua code) were tested.  6 iterations of barrier=0 and 10
iterations of barrier=1.

So my hope is we can now put this general dm-crypt barrier doubt to one
side and work together on identifying the cause of corruption when
dm-crypt is paired with btrfs.

Thanks,
Mike
