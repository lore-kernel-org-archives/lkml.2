Hmm - I could imagine that we're wasting a lot of possible speed gain
by not exploiting that feature on ARMv6+.

My suggested COPY4 replacement probably has a lot of load stalls - maybe some
ARM expert could have a look and suggest a more efficient implementation.

In any case, I still would like to see the new code in linux-next because
of the huge improvements on other modern CPUs.
