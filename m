Apologies for top-posting. The SSD on my laptop died, and so I'm stuck using webmail for this account...

Our experience with nfsiod is that the WQ_MEM_RECLAIM option still deadlocks despite the "rescuer thread". The CPU that is running the workqueue will deadlock with any rpciod task that is assigned to the same CPU. Interestingly enough, the WQ_UNBOUND option also appears able to deadlock in the same situation.

Sorry, I have no explanation why...

Cheers,
  Trond

OK, coming back after reviewing Documentation/workqueue.txt: the
workqueues potentially involved here are rpciod and the server's
laundromat and callback workqueues.

The former is created with

        alloc_workqueue("rpciod", WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, 1);

and the latter two are both created with
create_singlethread_workqueue(), which also sets WQ_MEM_RECLAIM.

As I understand it, that ensures that each of the three has at least one
"rescuer" thread dedicated to it--so there shouldn't be any deadlock as
long as there's no circular dependency among the three.

So think this is a false positive--am I missing something?

No, the waiting's intentional: for example, the laundromat wq is what's
responsible for reaping expired clients, and it wants to wait for
callback rpc's to exit.  (If I remember right they may reference data
structures we're about to clean up).

--b.
