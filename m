This appears to be the first time this problem has come up.  But it is 
a real problem.

If a child device was runtime-suspended when a system suspend began, 
then there will be nothing to prevent its parent from 
runtime-suspending as soon as it is woken up during the system resume.  
Then when the time comes to resume the child, the resume will fail 
because the parent is already back at low power.

On the other hand, there are some devices which should remain at low 
power across an entire suspend-resume cycle.  The details depend on the 
device and the platform.

This suggests that the PM core is not the right place to solve the 
problem.  One possible solution is for the subsystem or device driver 
to call pm_runtime_get_sync(dev->parent) at the start of the 
system-resume procedure and pm_runtime_put_sync(dev->parent) at the 
end.
