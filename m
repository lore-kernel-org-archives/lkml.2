We had this discussion in May-June 2008; it's because the nfsds were  
once  many many years ago userspace threads.

The "killall nfsd" semantics in those scripts are awful and lead to  
problems shutting down when there are lots of threads. It would  
probably be an improvement to provide a better shutdown mechanism and  
force distros to use it.

Or, you could preserve the effective semantics by having a single  
"nfsd" thread whose purpose is to notice that it's being signalled and  
perform a clean shutdown (perhaps blocking the thread doing the kill()  
call until the shutdown has completed).
