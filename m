I've reported a similar oops related to the above commit:
  [BUG] Oops when SCSI device under multipath is removed
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/8/10/11

Elevator being removed is the core of the problem.
And the essential issue seems 2 different models of queue/driver relation
implied by queue_lock.

If reverting the commit is not an option,
until somebody comes up to fix the essential issue,
the patch below should close the regressions introduced by the commit.

Thanks,

This patch moves elevator_exit() and blk_throtl_exit() from
blk_cleanup_queue() to blk_release_queue() when it is possible.

elevator_exit() and blk_throtl_exit() were called in blk_cleanup_queue()
because they use queue_lock.

There are 2 types of queue_locks:
  a) supplied by driver (via blk_init_queue)
  b) embedded in struct request_queue (__queue_lock)

When queue_lock is supplied by driver, there is no guarantee that
the pointer is valid after blk_cleanup_queue(), so they have to be
called in blk_cleanup_queue().
In this case, the driver has to make sure nobody is using the queue
before calling blk_cleanup_queue().

However, OTOH, if queue_lock is '__queue_lock' in request_queue,
blk_release_queue() is better place for freeing structures
because the block layer knows for sure there is no reference.

This patch is ugly but should fix various oopses introduced by this change:
  86cbfb5607d4b81b1a993ff689bbd2addd5d3a9b
  [SCSI] put stricter guards on queue dead checks
