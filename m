The choice of ACL format is a persistant property of the filesystem, not
of a single mount of the filesystem: for example, people can't try out
richacls for one mount and then decide to revert bacak to posix acls.

(Right?)  So I'm assuming we should use the latter--but I don't
understand what ext4 compat flags are.... Is there some disadvantage to
using them?
