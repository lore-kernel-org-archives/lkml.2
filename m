So we have the problem where directory changes (ie file creation and deletion) takes a long time (some times an infinitely long time) to propagate to clients.  Plus: directories don't change very often, so using fine-grained time stamps only on directories wouldn't impact heavy I/O workloads.

I'm don't quite see how close-to-open really affects this issue - it still
relies on the timestamps and so can cache old data if a file update didn't
change the timestamp.

In my mind the difference is that near-concurrent access to files usually
involves file locking which flushes caches (and if it doesn't then you have
bigger problems) while near-concurrent access to directories relies on the
natural atomicity of dir operations so no locking or flushing occurs.

So I agree that this is probably more of an issue for directories than for
files, and that implementing it just for directories would be a sensible
first step with lower expected overhead - just my reasoning seems to be a bit
different.

Thanks,
