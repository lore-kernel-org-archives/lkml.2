If pointer has the rcu mark, and somehing access this pointer without
proper locking, then automatic checkers (sparse...) will trigger a
warning, this is what Paul said.

Example of such checks, 

# define __percpu   __attribute__((noderef, address_space(3))) 

If someone tries to manipulate a __percpu marked ptr without proper API,
sparse loudly complains.

If you dont own a lock, and test a pointer, what guarantee do you have
this pointer doesnt change right after you tested it ?

If *something* protects the pointer from being changed, then how can be
expressed this fact ?

If nothing protects the pointer, why test it then, as result of test is
unreliable ?

If NFS was using rcu_dereference(), it probably was for a reason, but if
nobody can recall it, it was a wrong reason ?

Sorry, too many questions and no answer I guess...
