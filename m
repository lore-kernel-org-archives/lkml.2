Agreed.
BTW, it's udevd on my Linux box that changed the default poll msecs kernel param
which caused sr_check_events being called every 2 seconds.

For the ODD to be put into suspend state, the conditions should be:
1 tray closed
2 no media inside
I think we missed the condition 1 check now.

And if we follow the two conditions, the events can be safely ignored.

What do you think of blocking events for it when going to suspend and unblocking
when resume? This could erase the unnecessary calls of the check events function
when ODD is suspended.
But disk_(un)block_events are not exported and can't be used in sr
module. So I'm
not sure how to do this.

Another thing to consider is, user might want to eject the tray by
software like the
eject /dev/sr0 command or some UI mouse clicks against the cdrom icon. I'm still
thinking how to do this correctly.

I guess the earlier call of get device is this?

 869 int scsi_sysfs_add_sdev(struct scsi_device *sdev)
... ...
 891
 892        /* The following call will keep sdev active indefinitely, until
