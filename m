Yes, he picked regular CRC32, which has a reasonably fast slice-by-4
software implementation.  For ext4, my original choices were hw acceleration or
the slower single-byte lookup table.  With hw acceleration the overhead of
adding the checksums is about ~10% (for just the metadata operations); with the
single-byte table it was about 50%; and with the proposed slice-by-8 patch it's
about 20%.  Hopefully I can optimize this even more in the future.

I would hope so, since the IP checksum is much simpler than any CRC...
