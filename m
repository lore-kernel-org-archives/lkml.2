Yes, the driver has direct access to the data. Usually, the data is
not copied for I/O requests. The driver gets one sg list that points
to the data pages of file system (or whatever the data source is).
When the filesystem decides to change the data, this single data
buffer is changed.

Sure, you can create copies of data buffers in the driver, calculate
the checksum of the copy and submit the data copy with the checksum to
the hardware controller. This is usually not done for performance
reasons, and you probably should keep a mempool to be able to issue
I/Os when memory is low.
