Yeah, sorry for dropping the ball on this one (and missing my original
GCC 4.7 target ...)

Well, it matters because it shows that simply using the declared type
isn't going to work in the end.  What we instead need to do is
remember the underlying objects the bitfield packing algorithm uses.
It then simply becomes obvious how to implement the bitfield accesses.
I hope to get back to this for GCC 4.8.

Heh, but of course the ABI specifies they are supposed to be packed ...

In the end we all agree GCC does something nasty (and I would call
it a bug even), but any solution we find in GCC won't be backportable
to earlier releases so you have to deal with the GCC bug for quite
some time and devise workarounds in the kernel.  You'll hit the
bug for all structure fields that share the largest aligned
machine word with a bitfield (thus the size depends on the alignment
of the full object, not that of the struct containing the bitfield
in case that struct is nested inside another more aligned one).
This situation should be easily(?) detectable with sparse.

Thanks,
Richard.
