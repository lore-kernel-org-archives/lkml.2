Don't do it.

i_mutex is already overloaded, and this does not fit into any
of the somewhat reasonable uses cases for it, which are:

 a) for directories the VFS uses it to protect the tree topology
 b) for regular files all generic I/O code currently uses it to
    serialize writers.
 c) the VFS uses it around truncate, and setxattr updates
 d) filesystems abuse it for internal metadata in various places

As you can see right now we do not hold it over any file operation,
and I'm absolutely against adding that.  I'd rather untange the
current uses, specificly:

 - push synchronization of setattr into the filesystems
 - push synchronization of xattr write operations into the filesystems
 - move the read/write synchronization to a separate shared/exclusive
   lock like it's already done in XFS, and like Lukas proposed for
   ext4.  This fixes the Posix compliance corner cases about reads
   beeing atomic vs writes, simplifies direct I/O locking a lot,
   and allows for more parallel direct I/O support like XFS supports.
 - try to get rid of the abuses inside filesystems as much as possible.
