The SCSI EXTENDED COPY command (also known by the abbreviation "XCOPY")
is specified in the SPC (SCSI Primary Commands) series of standards, not
the SBC (SCSI Block Commands) series. Yes, it has been enhanced in the
SPC-4 drafts (what you term as "token copy") but as far as I can
determine, still allows for the original EXTENDED COPY command usage.
EXTENDED COPY was first standardized in SPC-2 (ANSI INCITS 351-2001) in
2001. The most recent SPC standard is SPC-3 (ANSI INCITS 408-2005) and
if VMWare don't mention some other SCSI standard or draft, then the
SPC-3 specification of the EXTENDED COPY command should be the
reference. And that is prior to the addition of the "token copy"
functionality.

The latest released version of my sg3_utils package (1.34) contains
a contributed sg_xcopy utility that invokes the SCSI EXTENDED COPY
command. At this time it does not support the recently added "token
copy" functionality.

Sorry to add another category.
