There were clear problems with the first version you posted and 
that's enough proof to request the exclusion of known-dangerous 
characters instead of including known-useful characters.

The point is to protect against known harm and not to turn it into 
"lets disable things broadly, just in case something unusual is 
harmful" kind of voodoo programming.

And yes, i very much expect someone *restricting* Linux utility to 
have *full* knowledge of the topic involved.

A black list is well-defined: it disables the display of certain 
characters because they are *known to be dangerous*.

A white list on the other hand does it the wrong way around: it tries 
to put the 'burden of proof' on the useful, good guys - and that's 
counter-productive really.

I don't mind protecting against known threats, with emphasis on 
'known'.

Thanks,
