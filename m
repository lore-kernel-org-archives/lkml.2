I'm sure this information is also dangerous.

This is not a problem of all non-net netlink sockets, but only of those
who finds a task by the pid.  AFAIU, the normal netlink policy is using
broadcast packets.


3) A process cannot own 2 taskstats sockets because the information
stored in listeners array doesn't make difference between different
sockets of the same task.  Both searches would stop on the first socket,
the first socket would receive 2 messages while the second would be
silent.  It was introduced by f9fd8914c1acca0.

Umm, if one did unshare() or clone() to unshare only net namespace?
