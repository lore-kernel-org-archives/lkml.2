Regardless of what RFC mandates and what is returned to client, (Which sounds
very unrobust to me) I'm sure the client handles nfserr_reclaim_bad just
fine.

It's the server that's getting stuck in its own feet and stops responding.
That's what I meant. We should always resume normal operations after
the grace period ends.

I did not see any reports of client getting into trouble because of
unexpected nfserr_reclaim_bad, did you?

Thanks
