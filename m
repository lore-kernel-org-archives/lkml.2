While I generally don't like adding tunables, this seems like it might
be a reasonable place for one. There's been a lot of debate about what
the correct behavior should be on a retry.. A tunable would allow us to
experiment with different values.

That said, I'm warming up to Miklos' suggestion about adding an
ESTALERETRY error code. If we go that route then it's reasonably simple
to retry indefinitely on that return from the lower fs.
