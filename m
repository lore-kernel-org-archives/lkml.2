We can throw 1000x more CPU power and memory at the problem than
we could 13 years ago. IOW the system balance hasn't changed (even
considering pci-e SSDs) compared to 13 years. Hence if it was a bad
tradeoff 13 years ago, it's still a bad tradeoff today.

Proliferation of mount options just to enable feature X of API Y for
filesystem Z is not a good idea. Either you enable it via the
fallocate API or you don't allow it at all.

How does this differ from a local filesystem? Are you talking about
storage nodes for clustered/cloudy storage?

If so, I know of quite a few places that use XFS for this purpose
and they all seem to measure storage in petabytes made up of small
boxes containing anywhere between 30-100TB each. The only request
for additional preallocation functionality I've got from people
running such applications recently is for XFS_IOC_ZERO_RANGE. This
is quite relevant, because that specifically converts allocated
extents to unwritten extents. i.e. they like to be able to
efficiently re-initialise allocated space to zeros rather than
have it contain stale data.

That's not really a convincing argument for a new interface that
needs to be maintained forever.

It could, but it still needs better justification.
