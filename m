If you guys want to test how long trims take, Lukas wrote a test program
that does this.  It can be found here:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/test-discard/

It will even spit out nice graphs that show you b/w, average trim
duration, maximum duration, etc.

Some devices are better than others.  We've definitely seen trims take a
lot of time compared to regular I/O.  However, using the batched discard
ioctl in a cron job, I don't think we have to worry about this
particular problem.  And I don't buy the argument that users want to do
this by hand.  Most users want things to Just Work(TM).

Cheers,
Jeff
