I've made it clear for some time now why this is design is broken for
us, and why moving the default login path to userspace for a dynamically
controlled target mode fabric is a *bad* idea:

Yes, but that does not help for moving forward for v3.1 code.

I am not sure what you mean here.  I think the reasons why it's wrong
are obvious for the default login path because as Mike mentioned it
quickly moves from a simple kernel/user split interface to a complex one
because userspace needs to become more and more aware of specific
protocol state changes.

With a completely dynamic control plane and object library with
iscsi-target, it makes no sense to push the entire login path to
userspace, and only makes the default login cases that users want more
difficult to configure and manage.

Impossible is a very strong word for pushing iSCSI authentication
payloads (and not the entire login process) to userspace, especially
considering that is what v2.x iscsi-target originaly did before the
conversion to the modern libcrypto/md5 based in-kernel CHAP state
machine login we have here today.

Yes, but the important bit is that application devels should not be
talking to configfs directly anyways.  The rtslib object library is the
API that the default set of CHAP auth credentials (along with everything
else) are properly exposed to higher level apps, and where presenting a
consistent API is very important.

This is also where the 'optional to implement' authentication pieces
would also need to be enabled with seperate authentication daemons
attached to individual TargetName+TargetPortalGroupTag endpoints, so
that the kernel configfs control plane is *not* effected directly by
userspace code for the default login cases.

Making a change to iscsi-target kernel code for optionally pushing
RFC-3720 Login Phase CSG=0 (SecurityNegotiation) payloads into a
seperate codepath is really pretty simple for the main login codepath,
and I would be willing to add a simple example for doing authentication
payload passthrough for future 'optional to implement' authentication
methods post merge if there is actually enough interest to support
'optional to implement' security methods for the next round.

This would clearly demonstrate that it's possible to do the type of
thing for the future methods in the non default path, and not push the
main login process outside of the kernel.
