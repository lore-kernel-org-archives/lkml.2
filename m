  Thanks for clarification!

  Ups! I now had a look at what xfs_rw_ilock() does. I always thought it's
just a plain rw semaphore and now I see it takes several locks depending on
the argument. Ugh, a bit surprising for XFS newcomer as me ;) But now
things become clearer so I fix my patches with this new knowledge in mind.
So just disregard my locking comments. They were likely bogus.
