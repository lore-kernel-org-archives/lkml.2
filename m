Actually, I wasn't advocating that.  I think block should return a guard
mismatch error.  I think somewhere in filesystem writeout is the place
to decide whether the error was self induced or systematic.  For self
induced errors (as long as we can detect them) I think we can just
forget about it ... if the changed page is important, the I/O request
gets repeated (modulo the problem of too great a frequency of changes
leading to us never successfully writing it) or it gets dropped because
the file was truncated or the data deleted for some other reason.
