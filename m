So what's the advantage of user space?

Traditionally, kernel/userspace splits have been:
 - fragile as hell
 - more code
 - slower
 - complicated to set up
 - problematic with backwards compatibility issues
and these days when I see some kernel functionality that needs user
space support, I just go "f*ck, that's going to be a pain".

So I think the "that part can be done in user space" argument is
fundamentally crap.

Now, if it is an issue of "that can be done BETTER in user space
BECAUSE xyz", then that's a different issue. I haven't seen that
argument, though.
