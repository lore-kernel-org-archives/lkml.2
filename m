Well it sort of is, as the people working on cifsfs are also
Samba Team members, but this isn't an official "Samba" thing,
as I can't see exactly what apps would want this either (other
than Samba smbd running on top of smbd, re-exporting a cifsfs
share, pointing to a Samba server, running on a... ERROR STACK
OVERFLOW :-).
