Sorry for the large recipient list but I think there's a need.
I've made very little progress on this but my most recent development
deserves an update.

Most recent kernel used is 2.6.38-rc4.

I'm seeing a reference being gained, or perhaps not being released
quickly enough after a close(2) on a file handle open on a mount point
being umounted seen in the backtrace [1] below. I can't say if there is
more than one like this because the BUG() stops the umounting. I'm
thinking of modifying the code to try and continue to see what else I
can find out.

I get this quite reliably running the test described above.

I've looked long and hard at the vfs-scale path walking code (and the
vfs-automount code) and I can't yet see how this could be possible.

Here are some observations I've made so far.

In this segement of code in autofs4:

int autofs4_d_manage(struct dentry *dentry, bool mounting_here, bool rcu_walk)
{
        struct autofs_sb_info *sbi = autofs4_sbi(dentry->d_sb);

        DPRINTK("dentry=%p %.*s",
                dentry, dentry->d_name.len, dentry->d_name.name);

        /* The daemon never waits. */
        if (autofs4_oz_mode(sbi) || mounting_here) {
                if (!d_mountpoint(dentry))
                        return -EISDIR;
                return 0;
        }

        /* We need to sleep, so we need pathwalk to be in ref-mode */
        if (rcu_walk)
                return -ECHILD;

        /* Wait for pending expires */
        do_expire_wait(dentry);

        /*
         * This dentry may be under construction so wait on mount
         * completion.
         */
        return autofs4_mount_wait(dentry);
}

If I move the

        /* We need to sleep, so we need pathwalk to be in ref-mode */
        if (rcu_walk)
                return -ECHILD;

above the

        /* The daemon never waits. */
        if (autofs4_oz_mode(sbi) || mounting_here) {
                if (!d_mountpoint(dentry))
                        return -EISDIR;
                return 0;
        }

I almost never see the problem in the first stage of the test, that
being the nobrowse configuration, but almost always see it in the second
stage, the so called browse configuration. Which amounts to saying that
the problem appears to happen more often when mount point directories in
the automount headachy exist before being mounted on and are not removed
when they are expired. Unfortunately it isn't as simple as that either
since the automount map itself is fairly complex. Still, I thought it
worth mentioning.

The most recent curious thing is that if I change the test a bit to use
bind mounts on local paths instead of NFS mounts I don't get this BUG()
at all. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is necessarily an NFS
problem, it may be that the reduced latency of bind mounts changes the
test behavior and hides the bug. So I'd appreciate some help from NFS
folks in case it is something that needs to be changed in NFS, since I
can't see anything that might cause it in the NFS code myself.

If anyone would like to try and run the test themselves I'll work on
decoupling it from the RHTS infrastructure within which it is currently
implemented.
