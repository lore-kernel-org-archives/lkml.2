No, udev can not create such a link after the preferred name is set, as
it has no way of knowing that the name was set.

It also doesn't solve the issue of userspace wanting to use such a
"preferred" name in the command line of tools, as there will not be a
link back to the "kernel" name directly in /dev/.

So as userspace tools will still need to be fixed, I don't see how
adding a kernel file for this is going to help any.  Well, a bit in that
the kernel log files will look "different", but again, that really isn't
a problem that userspace couldn't also solve with no kernel changes
needed.
