Yes, it allows to distinguish pipes from anything else. Initially this patch was
a part of early rfc on checkpoint/restore facility (mostly implemented in
userspace). So we need to distinguish somehow pipes when we dump data from
/proc/pid/fd. That's the main reason. BUT since this patch can be used without
any other c/r bits and can be treated separately I've sent it alone without
any mention of c/r at all.
