I haven't been keeping up with this thread, but I believe NTFS has a
number of timestamps, not just 3.

This blog post references 8 in the left hand column.

The 4 standard (most common) ones are:

File last access
File last modified
File created
MFT last modified

My understanding is that "MFT last modified" has semantics very
similar to Linux ctime.

But there is not a generic equivalent to NTFS created.

Thus if trying to have the Linux kernel match NTFS semantics for the
benefit of Samba is the goal, it seems a new field should be preferred
instead of having linux ctime try to do different jobs.
