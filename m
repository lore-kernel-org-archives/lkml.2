You can only renoew the ticket before it expires if it hasn't yet expired.

Imagine this case:

I go home for the evening.

The screensaver kicks in.

The machine suspends to ram.

The ticket expires.  Yes, it was renewable but nobody could renew it 
because they were asleep.

I come back the next morning, hit a key, the unlock screen pops up, I 
enter my password, pam_krb5 gets a new ticket.
