Drop this for the moment. It was a long shot at best and there is little
evidence the problem is in this area.

I'm attaching two patches. The first is the NO_KSWAPD one to stop
kswapd being woken up by SLUB using speculative high-orders. The second
one is more drastic and prevents slub entering direct reclaim or
compaction. It applies on top of patch 1. These are both untested and
afraid are a bit rushed as well :(

Subject: [PATCH] mm: slub: Do not wake kswapd for SLUBs speculative high-order allocations

To avoid locking and per-cpu overhead, SLUB optimisically uses
high-order allocations and falls back to lower allocations if they fail.
However, by simply trying to allocate, kswapd is woken up to start
reclaiming at that order. On a desktop system, two users report that the
system is getting locked up with kswapd using large amounts of CPU.
Using SLAB instead of SLUB makes this problem go away.

This patch prevents kswapd being woken up for high-order allocations.

Subject: [PATCH] mm: slub: Do not take expensive steps for SLUBs speculative high-order allocations

To avoid locking and per-cpu overhead, SLUB optimisically uses
high-order allocations and falls back to lower allocations if they
fail.  However, by simply trying to allocate, the caller can enter
compaction or reclaim - both of which are likely to cost more than
the benefit of using high-order pages in SLUB. On a desktop system,
two users report that the system is getting locked up with kswapd
using large amounts of CPU. Using SLAB instead of SLUB makes this
problem go away.

This patch prevents SLUB taking any expensive steps when trying to use
high-order allocations. Instead, it is expected to fall back to smaller
orders more aggressively.
