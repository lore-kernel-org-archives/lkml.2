We'll have to get some feedback from Rafael, but the way I percieved
it, the patch (2) fixes a very real race, then fixing that makes it
necessary for drivers using runtime_pm to do things differently to
be on the safe side. But none were really fixed when first merging
it.

So on second thought you probably only want patch (2)
"PM: Limit race conditions between runtime PM and system sleep (v2)"
for stable.
