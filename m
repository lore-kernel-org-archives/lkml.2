	We use ethernet crc32 in ocfs2.  btrfs uses crc32c.  Frankly, I
could have used crc32c if I'd really thought about the hardware
acceleration benefits.  I think it's a good idea for ext4.

	ocfs2 adds trailer entries to every dirblock for the checksum.
We also do our dirindex free list there.  Since ocfs2 dirblocks are ext3
dirblocks, I bet you can rip off a lot of that code, including the
feature compatibility stuff.  See ocfs2_fs.h.

	I really think you should checksum every metadata block.  A few
things will take some effort to shoehorn it in, but it is worth it.
