How does it fail?  postgres errors?  kernel errors?

OK, so to be clear: your testing is on dm-crypt + ext4?

And you're testing upstream based kernels (meaning the dm-crypt
scalability patch that has been in question is _not_ in the mix)?

That is a very different report than the other 2 reports of corruption
(those corruption instances were only seen once the dm-crypt scalability
patch was introduced).
