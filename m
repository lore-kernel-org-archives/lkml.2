So we could easily send both and only believe RC10 if the device is
under 2TB.  However, what about all the extra flags we read out of RC16,
like trim, large sector size and DIF capability?  If the device lies
about its capacity, won't we get bogus values for those as well, which
is going to cause other screw ups?
