Ext4 supports non-journal mode, and there are a few users (Google, Taobao, etc.).
A trigger of jbd2 may not work well for non-journal Ext4 ...

And in non-journal mode, there is not copy of any meta data block in jbd2, we need to be
more careful in check summing, e.g. inode/block bitmap blocks...

Agree, enable/disable the trailer isn't that difficult. We need more eyes to take care the user space tools.
