Ok, the code is not very clear, but now I can see it. p_block is
actually misused here to store the number of indexes in the current
node while diving into the tree. Then on the way up, we are checking
that to see if the eh_entries changed or not (which is indicating
that something has been freed deeper in the tree).

That said, it makes sense to set it before the loop itself because
we are actually skipping the path construction while diving into
the tree since patch is already initialized and we're starting
walking back from 'depth' up in this case. So the patch seems fine.
Thanks for catching it and fixing it.

You can add

checkpatch.pl does not catch everything. Just look at how wrapping
of long lines is done in the code, there are plenty of examples.

Right, I've probably used the old patch as an example.

Thanks!
