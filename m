That approach would solve the problem.

It was deliberate to not make all dentrys as managed to avoid function
calls to ->manage() where possible but that might not be possible.

The priority right now though is the BUG() I'm getting due to the
elevated reference.

It turns out that the missing dput() you spotted won't trigger unless
user space does something stupid and that's why it didn't show up in
testing before.

Anyway, recent printk output is pointing me at do_filp_open() so I'm
probably going to need to look closely at it. I'm still gathering printk
evidence but I think that pain is coming.
