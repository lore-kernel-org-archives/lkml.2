In actual fact, on my 12 disk RAID0 array, XFS is faster with
unwritten extents *enabled* than when hacked to turn them off. Yes,
you can turn off unwritten extent tracking in XFS if you know what
you are doing, we just don't provide any interfaces to users to do
so because of all the security problems it entails.

The result (using 256MB prealloc file, 2000 sparse 4k block writes,
one with O_SYNC, the other done async with a post write sync), with
averages over 5 runs are:

		O_SYNC		post-sync
unwritten	7.297s		5.734s
stale		7.641s		6.108s

These results are consistently repeatable, and only reinforce the
point that if ext4 is slow using unwritten extent tracking, then
it's an implementation problem and not an excuse to add an interface
to expose stale data....

Cheers,

Dave.
