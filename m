Hello,
please could you add some comments about the problem or review the  
proposed patch?

Kernel 3.2.23 with Debian patches (Debian Wheezy, testing)
Debian bug#679545 (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=679545)

Machine: Dell PowerEdge 3250 (equivalent with Intel SR870BH2)
Processor: 2x Itanium Madison 1.5GHz 6M
Memory: 4GB

Intel ICH4 (82801DB), IDE host adapter. The ata_piix module fails to  
initialize.

You can read in the "Intel 82801DB I/O Controller Hub 4 (ICH4)" datasheet
(http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/82801db-io-controller-hub-4-datasheet.pdf)
about the EXBAR register at offset 0x24 (4 bytes):
"EXBAR register
This is a memory mapped BAR that requires 1 KB of DWord-aligned memory  
that is Intel reserved
for future functionality. BIOS needs to program the base address for a  
1-KB memory space."

The dump shows that EXBAR is 0x0000, equal to the default value after  
reset; EFI doesn't initialize it.

ata_piix uses pcim_enable_device() which enables this along with the  
I/O BARs. In systems based on the Intel SR870 platform the firmware  
does not initialize the EXBAR and pcim_enable_device() fails because  
the memory region 0x0-0x3FF cannot be allocated.

The proposed patch adds ia64 arch-specific 'pci quirk' code.
Since the patched Kernel doesn't see any memory resource of IDE  
hostadapter, it doesn't set the PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY bit in the CMD  
register; the EXBAR resource is *not* visible in the memeory space at  
all.

A snippet of the dmesg output on the patched Kernel:

(Note: The patch of this posting differs slightly from the one which I  
have posted on Debian bug#679545 - just cosmetic improvements.)

Kind regards,
