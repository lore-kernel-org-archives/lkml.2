This is actually how the hashtable API was looking in the first place - without
the _size functions.

The story here is that when I've introduced the original API which used macro
magic to work out the size, one of the first comments was that there are several
dynamically allocated hashtables around the kernels, and all this macro magic
wouldn't work.

I've grepped around the code and indeed saw several places which k*alloc/vmalloc
their hashtable, so I agreed with that and happily went ahead to extend the API
to have _size functions.

When I started converting more kernel code to use this new API, I also converted
two modules which kmalloced the hashtable, but instead of using the _size API I
ended up removing the allocation completely because it was unnecessary and
wasteful. And this is why you don't see _size being used anywhere in any of the
patches.

Looking at the kernel code again, I see several places where removal of dynamic
allocation won't work (see 'new_tl_hash' in drivers/block/drbd/drbd_nl.c for
example).

So I'd rather leave it in at least until we finish converting, as I see several
places which will definitely need it.
