Here lies my major concern about dirty_background_time: the write
bandwidth estimation is an _estimation_ and will sure become wildly
wrong in some cases. So the dirty_background_time implementation based
on it will not always work to the user expectations.

One important case is, some users (eg. Dave Chinner) explicitly take
advantage of the existing behavior to quickly create & delete a big
1GB temp file without worrying about triggering unnecessary IOs.

The numbers are impressive! FYI, I tried another NFS specific approach
to avoid big NFS COMMITs, which achieved similar performance gains:

nfs: writeback pages wait queue
