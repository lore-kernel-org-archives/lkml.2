Right, but you can't mount the same tmpfs instance in more than one mount
point.

Normal filesystems can have multi mount points, and an fs instance
is identified by device name, but cgroupfs ignores device name like
other pseudo filesystems. Instead a set of subsystems is used, so
to mount the same cgroupfs instance in different mount points, we
can do this:

	# mount -t cgroup -o cpuset xxx /cgroup1
	# mount -t cgroup -o cpuset xxx /cgroup2

Now we have the "none" option, so a cgroupfs can have no subsystems
bound to it, and we allow multi instances of such cgroupfs, so we
have to assign names to each instance:

	# mount -t cgroup -o none,name=hier1 xxx /cgroup1
	# mount -t cgroup -o none,name=hier2 xxx /cgroup2

Then we want to also mount "hier1" in another mount point, we can't
do this:

	# mount -t cgroup -o none xxx /mnt

because we have two different instances with "none" subsystem. So
we specify its name:

	# mount -t cgroup -o none,name=hier1 xxx /mnt

Hope I have made things clear to you?

What I try to fix here is the behavior of "mount -t cgroup -o name=xxx ..."
(no other options are specified), so what behavior do we want?

1. find if any existing cgroupfs instance matches the name, which is
the orginal behavior.

2. the same as "mount -t cgroup -o all,name=xxx ...", which is the
current behavior due to the commit that broke (1).

3. make it invalid and fail to mount.

4. any other idea?
