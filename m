And no-journal mode isn't possible in ext3 :)

Actually unless I'm totally confused, this patch doesn't apply at all,
and we already have:

        if (log_start_commit(journal, commit_tid)) {
                log_wait_commit(journal, commit_tid);
                goto out;
        }

        /*
         * In case we didn't commit a transaction, we have to flush
         * disk caches manually so that data really is on persistent
         * storage
         */
        if (test_opt(inode->i_sb, BARRIER))
                blkdev_issue_flush(inode->i_sb->s_bdev, NULL);
out:
        return ret;

in ext3_sync_file(), from commit 56fcad29d4b3cbcbb2ed47a9d3ceca3f57175417...
