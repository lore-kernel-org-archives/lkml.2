Not that I see, but don't let me stop you from trying to find one. ;)

We do something like this already. That's what the gencount thing is
all about. It's still possible though to fool that check if two calls
are scheduled closely enough.

Also note that it's not just the reordering of replies that you have to
concern yourself with. The requests themselves can be reordered on the
network. The server is also under no obligation to execute calls in the
order received.

Yeah, serializing things to fix this is probably a non-starter. NFSv2
and UDP transports are basically legacy code at this point, so there's
not a lot of incentive to do anything drastic here.

Correct. That was just an aside question for Trond or someone else who
understands the attribute revalidation code better than I do.
