On second thought, let's see what happens with groups that fail checksums ...
it seems that ext4_check_descriptors() fails the mount in the event of a group
descriptor failing checksum.  Both ext4_read_inode_bitmap() and
ext4_read_block_bitmap() return NULL if the respective bitmap fails checksum.
It looks like most of ext4's block {de,}allocate functions will fail on NULL
bitmap pointer, so it shouldn't be possible to allocate (or deallocate) from a
broken group.

There is one small deficiency: we need an explicit flag that marks the group
dead.  That way if either bitmap fails checksum, the other _bitmap_read()
function will know to just return NULL, and the group becomes totally frozen to
allocation activity.

I think ext4_new_inode need to be taught to continue scanning groups if it
encounters a "dead" group?  I'm not sure yet if the same thing needs to be
applied to the block allocation code.

I'm actually wondering how it is that a group could pass checksum verification
at mount time but fail it later, which is what that code snippet seems designed
to catch.  Maybe something related to online resize?   Either way, I'm now
wondering if we really need something like that for the simple case of bitmaps
failing checksum.  I think we're already covered, but maybe I missed something?
