Yeah, I think you'd have to remove the de_thread()-based assumptions 
in exec to avoid this. And then there's the can of worms opened by
non-pthread threads where files, signals, etc. may or may not be shared..

Re-creating all possible states from userspace is not necessarily going
to be any prettier. I'd really like to see SEIZE used to restart threaded
tasks before I'll be convinced it's any more or less pretty than a binfmt
handler.

You may have lost me here -- I have no idea whether this is a summary
or some new point you're trying to make.
