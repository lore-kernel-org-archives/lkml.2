I've tried that, but fundamentally the statistics we export in
taskstats is what a utility like top would need. Compare them against
cat /proc/$pid/sched and /proc/$pid/status

Except for the I/O part, which turned about to be a cause of concern,
look at struct taskstats and please see the comment above. We have
some additional delay statistics, but I don't see them as a core
broken issue

Or namespaces are not being used as much, I know a lot of users use
iotop(), I've frequently gotten and handled requests to enable the
feature across distros

That is lazy cleanup to avoid trapping exit events of listeners and
then having to check against the list. But if the cleanup needs to be
more active, it should be easy to fix. What I am saying is that it is
not as BROKEN as you make it sound. The attached patch is definitely a
step in the right direction and should be applied.

I beg to differ, due to the reasons above. I'd rather find time and
fix the pending issues (network namespace), you've fixed the pid
namespace issue. I'd also look for exiting listeners
