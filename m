2000 fsyncs per second, anyway.  I wasn't explicitly trying to limit any other
types of IO.

I actually picked 500us arbitrarily because it seemed to work, even for SSDs.
It was a convenient test vehicle, and not much more.  That said, I like your
recommendation much better.  I'll look into that.

I wondered if this would have been better off in the block layer than ext4?
Though I suppose that could imply two kinds of flush: flush-immediately, and
flush-shortly.  I intend to try those flush drain elimination patches before I
think about this much more.
