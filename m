Since uids are likely to be allocated in dense blocks, maybe an
unhashed multi-level lookup scheme might be appropriate.

Index an array with the low 8 (say) bits of the uid.
Each item can be either:  
  1) NULL => free entry.
  2) a pointer to a uid structure (check uid value).
  3) a pointer to an array to index with the next 8 bits.
(2) and (3) can be differentiated by the low address bit.
I think that is updateable with cmpxchg.

Clearly this is a bad algorithm if uids are all multiples of 2^24
but that is true or any hash function.
