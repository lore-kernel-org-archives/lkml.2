Yes, I am not trying to test hole punching: just trying to do my own
testing under traditional loads, and hitting problems in changes which
have gone into extN to fix up hole punching.

Some of the time I've been using an old fsx which doesn't even know
about fallocate(), some of the time a recent fsx from xfstests.  Most
of the time I've been using ext2, but occasionally I try it on ext4.

I think the only thing which makes the problems go away is blocksize
same as pagesize; but it's a long time since I tried nomblk_io_submit,
that made a big difference around 2.6.38/39, perhaps it still does.

In first quoted paragraph above, fsx failure.
