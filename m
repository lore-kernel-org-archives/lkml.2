OK, dropped.

Ok, sorry, I see what you mean wrt to UTS_RELEASE and dropping this
usage and generated/utsrelease.h include.

the 'vX.Y.Z on Linux/$ARCH' in the version string has been around for a
looong time, but I don't mind dropping it all together for the handful
of informational cases here.

Ok, will use this for the core_ prefixed bits..

Thanks, looking at the code now.

Ok, I will get this cleaned up for the NP login thread and TX conn
thread cases first and find+locate the issue mentioned above for the RX
case using kthread_stop()

<nod>, I am well aware of ->sk_data_ready() for directly accessing
struct sk_buff memory for the RX side case, and currently consider this
a future optimiziation item.

Yep, will get them cleaned up as the larger items are addressed.

Thanks Christoph!
