You cannot simply update linux system tcp parameters and expect nfs to 
work well performance-wise over the wan.  The NFS server does not use 
system tcp parameters.  This is a long standing issue.  A patch was 
originally added in 2.6.30 that enabled NFS to use linux tcp buffer 
autotuning, which would resolve the issue, but a regression was reported 
(http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/826598 ) and so they removed 
the patch.

Maybe its time to rethink allowing users to manually set linux nfs 
server tcp buffer sizes?  Years have passed on this subject and people 
are still waiting.  Good performance over the wan will require manually 
setting tcp buffer sizes.  As mentioned in the regression thread, 
autotuning can reduce performance by up to 10%.  Here is a patch 
(slightly outdated) that creates 2 sysctls that allow users to manually 
to set NFS TCP buffer sizes.  The first link also has a fair amount of 
background information on the subject.
