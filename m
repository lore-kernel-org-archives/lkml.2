No.  That is how Linux used to work, and it caused many problems,
which is why the current_fs_time() function was invented.

Not the problem.  As usual, the problem is out-of-order timestamps:

1) Modify file A
2) Modify file B
3) File B's inode gets evicted, truncating its timestamp to disk resolution
4) Call stat() on B, bringing it back in with truncated resolution

And boom, B appears to be OLDER than A.  Which is not allowed.

This is exactly what happened when Linux first added sub-second
timestamps to the generic VFS layer.  Many complaints about "make"
rebuilding files unecessarily, among other things.  Eventually it got
fixed by the introduction of current_fs_time().
