I noticed that the setups with low (<  8ms) flush times exhibit better performance when fsync coordination is not attempted, and the setups with higher flush times exhibit better performance when fsync coordination happens.  This also is no surprise, as it seems perfectly reasonable that the more time consuming a flush is, the more desirous it is to spend a little time coordinating those flushes across CPUs.

One thing I don't know for sure is whether 8ms is a result of 2*HZ (currently set to 250) or if 8ms is a hardware property.

This was done to allow aggregating sync journal operations for slow devices, and allowing fast (no delay) sync on fast devices.  See jbd2_journal_stop() for details.

I agree - we started on that dynamic batching when we noticed that single 
threaded writes to an array went at something like 720 files/sec (using fs_mark) 
and 2 threaded writes dropped down to 230 files/sec. That was directly 
attributed to the fixed (1 jiffie) wait we used to do.

Josef Bacik worked on the dynamic batching so we would not wait (sometimes 
much!) to batch other fsync/flushes into a transaction when it was faster just 
to dispatch them.

Related worry I have is that we have other places in the kernel that currently 
wait way too long for our current classes of devices....

Thanks,

Ric
