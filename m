Applied, but I really don't like the way you do it; note that e.g. foo/bar/.
gets that revalidation as well, for no good reason.  If anything, shouldn't
we handle that thing in the _beginning_ of pathname resolution, not in
the end?  For now it'd do, and it's a genuine regression, but...

BTW, here's a question for nfs client folks: is it true that for any two
pathnames on _client_ resolving to pairs (mnt1, dentry) and (mnt2, dentry)
resp., nfs_devname(mnt1, dentry, ...) and nfs_devname(mnt2, dentry, ...)
should yield the strings that do not differ past the ':' (i.e. that the
only possible difference is going to be in spelling the server name)?
