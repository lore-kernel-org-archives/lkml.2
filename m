Strictly speaking, portmapper is not required for NFSv4 service. 
However, the NFS infrastructure on Linux is still designed for NFSv2 and 
v3.  There remains some work needed to make portmapper optional for a 
v4-only server.  For now, continue to run it in order to handle kernel 
upcalls.

rpc.mountd is, however, still required on Linux NFSv4 servers.  Although 
NFSv4 clients do not contact the server's mountd, the kernel's NFS 
server performs upcalls to rpc.mountd to manage export information.  You 
can firewall off the mountd service on the server without affecting 
NFSv4 clients.  Recent versions of rpc.mountd accept command line 
options that disable the mountd network service while still handling 
kernel upcalls.

And, as long as lockd is running, you will need to keep rpc.statd 
around.  Again, you can firewall this service so that it is not exposed 
on the network, but it must continue to be available to handle kernel 
upcalls.  This is something we hope to address eventually as part of the 
lockd work Bruce mentioned.
