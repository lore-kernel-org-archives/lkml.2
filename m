Now the device task set is empty. Those commands are completed okay with the Linux device driver with SCSI Core (meaning done() were called, result is 0).

Just checked, the SCSI commands with a "implicit head of
queue" attribute are:
   - INQUIRY
   - REPORT LUNS
   - READ CAPACITY (10+16) [SBC]

On the subject of UAS, due to some USB-3 streaming protocol
requirements, three tag values cannot be used by SCSI. They
are 0h, FFFEh and FFFFh. So those available for SCSI tag
use are 1h to FFFDh inclusive.

So SCSI Core's error "handling" routine, sends ABORT TASK for TAG 3. *BUT* since tag 3 is free, immediately after the TMF, we see TUR with, guess what, tag 3, since as far as SCSI/Block layer are concerned, tag 3 is free
