Ah I had /dev/sdd kicked out of the RAID array, and a lot of SATA EH resets.
Those were apparently caused by a loose SATA cable:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/7/5/22
Those errors were for /dev/sdd though, not /dev/sdi (the XFS log disk).

Once I re-plugged all the SATA cables, and re-added /dev/sdd to the RAID array, all seemed well:

Jul  4 09:59:22 debian kernel: [   12.196238] XFS (md1p3): Ending clean mount

But when I shutdown the system later that day I got that log corruption error.
Could it be that the log  / some data on the disk was still corrupted (despite the successful mount, and RAID resync), which caused the
log error later?

The log is not on the RAID array though, it is on a separate disk, and that disk is indeed older than all
the other disks. Still SMART doesn't show any errors, and I've run a SMART short self-test, and conveyance self-test, and those didn't log any errors either.

Is the corruption in the log, or in the FS itself?
The FS itself could've been damaged when kicked out of the RAID.

Not yet, as I'm not sure if the problem was with the SATA cables
(and kicking out of sdd from the RAID), or the log disk itself.
And SMART shows no errors on the disk.

OK, I'll see if this happens again, and I'll replace the disk if it does.

Although is there supposed to be a performance benefit from having a separate log disk with XFS?
IIRC it has a disadvantage that you can't use barriers properly.
But if I'd move the log to be stored with the FS (on the RAID10 array), will XFS be able to use barriers there,
or RAID still prevents barriers from working?

Thanks,
