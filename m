Actually, many arches run just fine with QEMU's binary code translation
(alpha, mips, coldfire).  And since it's already pretty slow, using
virtio to improve performance is nice even in that scenario (which does
not require any kernel change).  But it's just an icing on the cake
indeed.  I can live with a BUILD_BUG_ON or better a "depends on
HAVE_SG_CHAIN" for the time being.

Because the scatterlist here would be allocated on the stack, I would
need to call it every time if I used sg_set_buf/sg_chain.

But sg_init_table is really just memset + set SG_MAGIC + sg_mark_end.
If you use the "full-init" APIs as above, you don't need any of those
(sg_chain undoes the flag changes in sg_mark_end and vice versa).

Right, better call them sg_init_buf/sg_init_page/sg_init_chain.

In the meanwhile, we still have a bug to fix, and we need to choose
between Sen Wang's v1 (sg_set_page) or v2 (value assignment).  I'm still
leaning more towards v2, if only because I already tested that one myself.
