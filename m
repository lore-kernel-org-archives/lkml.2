We use eh_generation in Lustre to detect if the extent tree is being changed while it is unlocked.

In the past, the discussion about adding checksums to the index and extent blocks was about using an ext4_extent_tail that contained not only the checksum of the block, but also a back-pointer to the inode/generation of the inode using this block.

That would allow e2fsck to verify that it is using the correct index/extent blocks and not pointing to a stale block that belonged to some other inode.

Since the header and index/extent entries are always 3 *__u32 in size, the extent tail can always be 4 * __u32 in size yet only consume a single slot in the block. There of course is no reason to put an extent tail inside the inode itself.
