Maybe you are confused by these XOR functions. But there is no
task->task_sectors, only for these TYPE_DISK pesky writes/reads

For general SCSI from tapes, scanners, printers to OSD There is
in_transfer_length and out_transfer_length. For READ_XXX/WRITE_XXX
these happen to be task->task_sectors.

There is no assumption they are completely separate (Even if they happen
to be the equal).

The fabric(s) know that. For pSCSI this comes in the scsi_in()->length
and the scsi_out()->length (and ->sg_count). For iscsi it has an rlenght
AHS header that tells it the transfer length of the bidi_read side.
In iSER and I think FB it is completely symmetrical like with the BSG
API. (Member for "in" and member for "out")

And so on. Each side is completely orthogonal to the other, in every
respect. (They might even execute in parallel)

Perhaps it would be easier to do, if you convert to use of scsi_data_buffer
in current code. Then apply the double instance. You might also need a similar
mechanics for your ->t_mem_list and associated members. Group them together
then double the handling.

Down the road you'll need a third one for supporting DIFF
