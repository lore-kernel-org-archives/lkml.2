Well, it's a problem and one that you'll probably have to address to
some degree. In truth, the fact that you're exporting different
subtrees in different containers is immaterial since they're both on
the same fs and filehandles don't carry any info about the path in and
of themselves...

Suppose for instance that we have a hardlinked file that's available
from two different exports in two different containers. The grace
period ends in container #1, so that nfsd starts servicing normal lock
requests. An application takes a lock on that hardlinked file. In the
meantime, a client of container #2 attempts to reclaim the lock that he
previously held on that same inode and gets denied.

That's just one example. The scarier case is that the client of
container #1 takes the lock, alters the file and then drops it again
with the client of container #2 none the wiser. Now the file got
altered while client #2 thought he held a lock on it. That won't be fun
to track down...

This sort of thing is one of the reasons I've been saying that the
grace period is really a property of the underlying filesystem and not
of nfsd itself. Of course, we do have to come up with a way to handle
the grace period that doesn't involve altering every exportable fs.
