If this is related to LSF, the notes on the I/O track are here:

So does that get us up to being a drop in replacement?  I think you're
saying that even with all of this, at least the VSCSI part will need
updating, so the answer seems to be "no".

I don't think so ... from a cursory glance it looks functional.

no; I still think MCS is a pointless duplication of multipath that only
works for iSCSI.
