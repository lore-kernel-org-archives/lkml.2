For the record, here's the patch I would propose.

At this point, I think it would be nice to Suleiman to say if he is 
still okay with the changes.

Subject: [PATCH] memcg: Reclaim when more than one page needed.

mem_cgroup_do_charge() was written before slab accounting, and expects
three cases: being called for 1 page, being called for a stock of 32 pages,
or being called for a hugepage.  If we call for 2 or 3 pages (and several
slabs used in process creation are such, at least with the debug options I
had), it assumed it's being called for stock and just retried without reclaiming.

Fix that by passing down a minsize argument in addition to the csize.

And what to do about that (csize == PAGE_SIZE && ret) retry?  If it's
needed at all (and presumably is since it's there, perhaps to handle
races), then it should be extended to more than PAGE_SIZE, yet how far?
And should there be a retry count limit, of what?  For now retry up to
COSTLY_ORDER (as page_alloc.c does), stay safe with a cond_resched(),
and make sure not to do it if __GFP_NORETRY.

[v4: fixed nr pages calculation pointed out by Christoph Lameter ]
