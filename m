I am afraid I also don't have too much answers for your questions, but
I do have more questions =)

I said that previously, but to this days the need for it still strikes 
me. I mean: the usecase is pretty clear. But every single cgroup is 
counting forks in a way or another. So for me, it would be better to 
simply count it as a cgroup property and act on it accordingly.

But then, of course, if you have multiple hierarchies, in which of them 
should you put that ? How ugly is it that you'll fail a fork, then check 
a hierarchy - no problem - only to later found out that this was 
configures in another hierarchy ?

Well, there is more. The use case we have in mind here, is Containers. 
To span a container, we put process in cgroups - we don't care about 
hierarchies, they are all the same - but then also need to put those 
same process in different namespaces.

This is quite cumbersome, because those are two completely different 
ways of achieving more or less the same thing, resource visibility. At 
some point, we need to allow the container admin to interface with those 
resources - traditionally done via /proc. And now the mess begins:

Part of /proc is namespace aware. So if you are reading your 
/proc/mounts file, this is okay. But part of the data coming from there, 
like /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/stat, or /proc/meminfo, really belong to 
cgroups. And in some cases, information comes from more than one cgroup. 
A consensus wasn't yet reached about what to do with it.

To be honest, I don't like that very much. I think once you have a 
directory-like structure, nesting of controlled resources should be 
assumed. But since I don't understand why this is this way to begin 
with, I'll leave it to someone else.

It sounds like the guys on TV proposing more debt to end the debt crisis...

Agree here.

Well, most of the controllers, can be in practice enabled or disabled. 
The mere fact that you live on a cgroup controller doesn't do anything 
until you start to set limits - with the big exception being the cpu 
controller - once you're there, it treats you as a sched entity. Maybe 
we should ensure that all cgroups can be either on/off. Then after that, 
we can group processes the way we want, and they may or may be not 
resource constrained, depending on what you put on your files.

This can be combined with a mechanism to lock the tasks file for 
removal, then maybe we can end up in a better awareness situation - 
maybe it would be saner if you can be sure that once you put a task on a 
group, it won't just disappear...
