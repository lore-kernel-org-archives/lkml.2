The content of the patch really does not match the subject at all,
which is a rather bad thing.

Anyway, dropping from blkdev_reread_part and blkpg_ioctl is easy
enough, and fine from a quick audit of the functions.

Dropping it from blkdev_get/put also seems fine from a quick
glance.  But that should be part of pushing the BKL into
->open/release.
