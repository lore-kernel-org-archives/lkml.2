Hi James,

Did you do anything with these 2 scsi section mismatch patches from June 21?
I don't see them in any of your scsi git trees, although I could have
missed them.

Subject: [PATCH] scsi: fix NCR_Q720 section mismatch warning
http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=130868730409600&w=2

Subject: [PATCH] scsi: fix sim710 section mismatch warnings

Thanks,
