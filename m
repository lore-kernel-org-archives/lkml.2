Allow a proprietary non-GPL multipath driver, like EMC PowerPath, to
detach a scsi_dh using scsi_dh_detach.  This is an improvement over
requiring them to write 'detach' to /sys/block/sdX/queue/dh_state

End result is Linux and PowerPath can coexist without compromising
Linux's default handling of multipath LUNs.

Linux has suffered from the race where a scsi_dh is not available to be
attached to a SCSI device until too late (after an HBA driver has
started the SCSI device scan that may attach a scsi_dh).  Attaching a
scsi_dh too late results in default sense handling that does not
silently end IO to passive paths, which creates excessive delays and IO
errors during normal boot of a system with hundreds of LUNs.

To fix this the appropriate scsi_dh must be available to be attached
before an HBA driver's SCSI device scan.  But once attached, both
scsi_dh_alua and scsi_dh_emc are known to conflict with PowerPath --
allowing PowerPath to use scsi_dh_detach resolves such conflicts.
