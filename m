I didn't say maturity and quality, I said niche features.  Apparently
it's subjective, because both LIO and SCST think their own niche
features are essential and the other's are irrelevant.

So linux did begin as a student's home brewed OS kernel ...

Precisely.  Or said a different way: as long as you choose the most
community oriented of competing offerings, the community will fill any
perceived gaps.  Conversely, you can destroy a project simply by
alienating the community.  That's why community is more important than
feature set.

No, see above.  Many technically very competent potential additions to
linux have failed because of maintainer problems.

Look, I'm not interested in the backstabbing.  *Both* projects have
fairly large user bases and businesses with revenue models built around
them, so I see that argument as a wash for both sides.

I don't think it was a mistake. STGT gave us the userspace modifiability
that neither LIO nor STGT offered at the time.
