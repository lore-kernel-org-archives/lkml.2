Yep, ext4 is close to my wife's closet.

True, but not that fast on small files.

Except the question I've raised in first mail there's a point in all
those action. We are maintaining host that are used for building
software: random access, lot of small files and dirs (always a co),
heavy parallel IO. We were testing XFS vs ext4 a year ago and XFS was
around 10% slower on build times. We did not - yet - done same on
btrfs. Now we're looking for replacement for ext4 as we suffer from
those issue - but we were not aware of that until stepped into this
issue.

If you would like me to do some specific tests around ext4 and btrfs,
let me know.
