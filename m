Applications mixing gettimeofday and filesystem timesamps can currently
use clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE,...) - which returns tick
granular timestamps, the same as the filesystem timestamps - method to
avoid this issue.

However, Patrick LoPresti (cc'ed) was working on a similar issue here
connected to nfs.

It *should* be. But hardware issues can cause trouble here.

I think the discussion from earlier suggested that this be configurable
from a mount option so the performance/granularity trade-off can be
managed there. 

Potential pot-holes on the road here: Although I guess doing this on a
per-mount basis in the future could make it difficult for apps that use
CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE to function if fs granularity is increased. Some
sort of CLOCK_REALTIME_FS could be introduced to map to whichever
granularity is right, but that can only be done on a global basis.
Hrm...
