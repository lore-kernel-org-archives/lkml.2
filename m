Agreed, if we're going to add an xattr, then we might as well store
not just a boolean, but some indication of what part of the file was
corrupted.  The only complication is what if there are many memory
corruptions.  Do we store just the last ECC hard error that we
detected?  Or just the first?

It wasn't clear to me it was worth the extra complexity, but if there
are indeed for file systems that don't have or don't want to allocate
a spare bit in their inode structure, that might be a good enough
justification to add an xattr.  (Was this a hypothetical, or does this
constraint apply to XFS or some other file system that you're aware of?)

I would dearly love it if we could allocate a new EFSCORRUPTED errno.
I was about to follow XFS's lead and change ext4 to return EUCLEAN
instead of EIO in the cases of fs corruption, but that really is ugly
and gross...
