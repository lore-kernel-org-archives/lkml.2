Ok, I'll play with it.

I'm not sure that I understand the problem correctly.

Currently, idmap uses dentry taken from client's cl_rpcclient->cl_path
(see nfs_idmap_new()). cl_rpcclient (and cl_path) is initialized with
rpcmount resolved against mount namespace of mount process (see
nfs_create_rpc_client()).
I assume it's correct.
