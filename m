How so?  Assuming /dev/sdb is not accessible, /dev/sdb1 is accessible,
and no iopl/ioperm.

You mentioned crass/gross hacks.  Forcing apps to detect if you're
targeting a partition or a block device _is_ gross.

That I agree with.

Yes, it's not much code if I don't get into cgroups land and stick with
a ioctl to add and remove BPF filters that look at CDBs.  One downside
is that such filtering would likely be enabled by CAP_SYS_RAWIO.
Because of this, tweaking the filter on the fly is still not too easy
because I want to run as unprivileged as possible.  I guess some
privileged helper program can set the filter and send me back the file
descriptor via SCM_RIGHTS.  The filter will be preserved across that, right?

I still believe this is suboptimal in the general case, and that Jan's
customer has a bug.  But hey I would have ended up implementing the
filters anyway sooner or later, so I'd rather avoid further flames and
work on them with someone supporting the idea. :)  Reluctantly
