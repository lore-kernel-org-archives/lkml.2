Good catch!  Thanks for the patch.  I will include this into ext4
tree, and I will probably push it separately to Linus so that it gets
into 2.6.36, since this is a regresssion.

You didn't add a Signed-off-by: line, which is needed for Developer's
Certification of Origin (see section 1, subsection 16 of
Documentation/SubmittingPatches in the Linux source tree).  Can you
send confirmation that it's OK for me to add a Signed-off-by line for
you?  Thanks!!

It should be fine.  Remounting doesn't actually change out the struct
superblock.  There is a chance that the information might not be fully
complete if an error is printed exactly as the same time as
print_daily_error_info() is run, but I'm not sure it's worth trying to
protect against that race, since the worst that this will mean is a
confusing report in the /var/log/messages file, and the ext4 error
message will be printed right next to it, which will have all of the
information the system administrator will need.
