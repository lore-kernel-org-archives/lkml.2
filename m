Yes, as I said before, the problem is that the actual numbers are

1. not 1:1: there are several possible encodings of luns 0-255
2. hierarchical, so once you go beyond a single level you can't properly
use a numeric representation either.

the mid layer just uses the lun number as an encoding of the actual SAM
lun.  The key for us is that int_to_scsilun has to go back the other
way.
