Well, time to poke Vasiliy ;)

Yes, and I didn't find thy way to escape it (actually if there would not
be filldir+might_fault tuple I would create this all under mmap_sem and
would not need this flex_array or any temporary storage at all and code
would be a way simplier).

Ouch, somehow missed it, thanks!

No, it's needed, since it makes sure that if "impossible"
scenario happens and flex-arrays fails with preallocated
data so we will reach this point with used > 0 and ret = -ENOMEM
and thus will not call for proc_map_files_instantiate as needed.

1: Say we failed here

Due to (1) -- so we will have a number of files reference
taken and need to put them back.
