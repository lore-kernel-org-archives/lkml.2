Yes, sorry, I'll know not to skip -next, next time....

(My excuse: I've been advertising to -next only stuff that I've done
with and committed, and this was something I wasn't even sure I should

But I could have either mailed it out labelled as [RFC], or stuck it in
a throwaway branch to merge into my -next branch.)

Apologies again, and thanks for dealing with it so promptly.
