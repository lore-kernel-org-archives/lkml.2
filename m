There is a good possibility that I was mistaken on the 2.6.35.

I manually applied your patch to 3.0.0, compiled, removed sr-mod module and
inserted the newly compiled one.

With the vanilla one, I would see the buf % in wodim drop while the fifo was
full.  With the patch (removing the mutex), buf stayed above 98% and the
burn speed was 16x at the end (10x avg).

Seems to have fixed my problem.

Thanks.
