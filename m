At some point, the question is why would you do that?  Two parity drives for 
each 4 drive RAID-6 set and then mirror that 3 times (12 drives in total, only 2 
data drives)? Better off doing a 4 way mirror :)

I think that you are still missing the point.

If the lowest layer can repair the data, it would return the first validated 
answer. The major time sync would be the IO to read the sectors from each of the 
4 drives in your example, not computing the various combination of parity or 
validating (all done in memory).

If the RAID-6 layer failed, you would do the same for each of the mirrors which 
would read the IO from each of their RAID-6 low levels exactly once as well (and 
then verify in memory).
