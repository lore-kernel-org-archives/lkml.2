Yes, and I'm definitely not against that ;) The problem is that this
syscall was marked as deprecated and if people want to drop it we
need to find a way to provide this address back in a sake of c/r.

If c/r is the only _one_ who needs this facility than providing the
address via /proc might be worth thing to do (since I can wrap
it with CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE and a regular kernel won't see
this snippet at all).
