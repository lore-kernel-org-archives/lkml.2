I'm not ... but at the same time removable functionality in sd.c is
special cased in quite a few areas which makes it fragile but exercised.
Its fragility is somewhat mitigated by the fact that a lot of the
special casing separates the removable from the non-removable paths.

I don't want to increase that fragility by entangling the removable and
non-removable paths without a good reason for doing so.
