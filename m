I disagree that touching every single legacy LLD's SHT->queuecommand()
and failure paths in that code is a low rist change.

Yes,

I think with andmike's testing and ACKs for the necessary scsi_error.c
changes this would be an acceptable risk.

I think this would be considered high risk if the setting of the flag
explictly was required to obtain the default legacy operation.  With
this series that is not the case, as the default SHT->unlocked_qcmd=0
will allow legacy LLDs to function exactly the manner they expect, while
allowing modern LLDs to run in host_lock-less mode.
