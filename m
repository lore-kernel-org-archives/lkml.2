CFQ currently seems to be preempting any thread doing IO if a request has
been marked as metadata. I think this is going to be bad for any other IO
going on.

I wrote a small fio script which is doing buffered writes with bs=32K and I
am doing fsync on file after every 20 IOs (fsync=20). I am assuming that this
something close to writting a small file and then doing fsync on that. 

With that fio script running I launched firefox and measured the time it
takes.

Without patch
=============
real    0m13.141s
user    0m0.588s
sys     0m0.164s

real    0m11.859s
user    0m0.580s
sys     0m0.163s

real    0m13.384s
user    0m0.587s
sys     0m0.163s

With patch
==========
real    0m25.986s
user    0m0.627s
sys     0m0.150s

real    0m29.582s
user    0m0.623s
sys     0m0.156s

real    0m25.898s
user    0m0.587s
sys     0m0.160s

So it looks like that firefox launching times have seems to just almost doubled.

My fio script looks like as follows.

*******************************************
[global]
directory=/root/fio/
ioscheduler=cfq

group_reporting=1

exec_prerun='echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'

new_group=1
rw=write
fsync=20
