Isn't this completely broken then? We can have slabs with lots of
objects but none are reclaimable - e.g. dirty inodes are not even on
the inode LRU and require IO to get there, so repeatedly scanning
the slab trying to free inodes is completely pointless.

If the shrinkers are not freeing anything, then it should be backing
off and giving thme some time to clean objects is a much more
efficient use of CPU time than spinning madly. Indeed, if you back
off, you can do another pass over the LRU and see if there are more
pages that can be reclaimed, too, so you're not dependent on the
shrinkers actually making progress to break the livelock....

Cheers,

Dave.
