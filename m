So using ONESHOT is a demand for current epoll coding design, and
DISABLE is try to solve the issue of that design?

I don't have many using experience on epoll as you guys :), so allow me
to ask one question:

Will it be very useful if we can using DISABLE with out the limitation
on ONESHOT?

Which means what ever the ep is, if DISABLE return 0, we are safe to
erase that fd.
