I can't specify right now. Need to search over lkml history.
That's all what I've found for now:

Yes, we are. But at least we are avoiding patching of task subsystem.

Gm...
This idea is not stupid. If I understand you right, you suggest to implement a 
service per network namespace (i.e. not only data, but also threads)?
