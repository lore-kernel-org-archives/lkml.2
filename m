Not really, he just said "It is frequently useful to sync a single file system",
without giving any use cases. He then gave two situations where either sync or
fsync isn't sufficient, to which I replied earlier and you called missing the
point. But that's not the same as giving a use case.

Did you use the remount trick or the ioctl? If the latter, is it sufficient
for your need? If the first, would guaranteeing that mount -o remount,rw
trick will keep working solve the problem for you?

When or why would you want to sync one specific filesystem? As you're doing
it, you could explain your use case better instead of telling me I'm missing
the point.

If sync(2) didn't exist and people wanted to add it I'd complain too. This
has all the problems of sync(2), but with the "not sure if all the files are
on the file system I think" problem added.

Greetings,

Indan
