Thanks Greg, good that you told us what we've been doing.  I would have
forgot myself if you didn't remember me.

Both Lukas and I have done extensive benchmarks on various SSDs and
thinkly provisioned raids.  Unfortunately most of the hardware is only
available under NDA so we can't publish it.

For the XFS side which I've looked it I can summarize that we do have
arrays that do the online discard without measureable performance
penalty on various workloads, and we have devices (both SSDs and arrays)
where the overhead is incredibly huge.  I can also say that doing the
walk of the freespace btrees similar to the offline discard, but every
30 seconds or at a similarly high interval is a sure way to completely
kill performance.

Or in short we haven't fund the holy grail yet.
