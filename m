How about this then?

Subject: [PATCH] Protect execve from being used after 'setuid' exceeds RLIMIT_NPROC

Many programs to not check setuid for failure so it is not safe
for it to fail.  So impose the RLIMIT_NPROC limit by noting the
excess in set_user with a process flag, and failing exec() if the
flag is set.

The patch http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/13/226 introduced a RLIMIT_NPROC
check in set_user() to check for NPROC exceeding via setuid() and
similar functions.  Before the check there was a possibility to greatly
exceed the allowed number of processes by an unprivileged user if the
program relied on rlimit only.  But the check created new security
threat: many poorly written programs simply don't check setuid() return
code and believe it cannot fail if executed with root privileges.  So,
when the check fails we set a process flag which causes execve to fail.

Following examples of vulnerabilities due to processes not checking
error from setuid provided by Solar Designer <solar@openwall.com>:

Here are some examples for 2011-2010:

"... missing setuid() retval check in opielogin which leads to easy root
compromise":

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/22/6

"The /usr/lib/libgnomesu/gnomesu-pam-backend suid binary which belongs
to the libgnomesu package is not checking setuid() return values.

As a result, two cooperating users, or users with access to guest,
cgi or web accounts can run arbitrary commands as root very easily."
