Subject: [PATCHv4 0/5] ext4: stop using write_super and s_dirt
Date: Wed,  4 Jul 2012 15:21:49 +0300

This patch-set makes ext4 file-system stop using the VFS '->write_supers()'
call-back and the '->s_dirt' superblock field because I plan to remove them
once all users are gone.

Most of the ext4 changes were done or suggested by Jan Kara (thanks!). This
patch does not do anything complex - we basically notice that ext4 does not
really needd the 'write_super()' functionality and we can remove it. We
mark the superblock buffer as dirty directly, rather than posponing this till
the next 'sync_supers()' kernel thread wake-up.

Tested with xfstests (both journalled and non-journalled ext4 modes).

Reminder:

The goal is to get rid of the 'sync_supers()' kernel thread. This kernel thread
wakes up every 5 seconds (by default) and calls '->write_super()' for all
mounted file-systems. And the bad thing is that this is done even if all the
superblocks are clean. Moreover, many file-systems do not even need this end
they do not register the '->write_super()' method at all (e.g., btrfs).

So 'sync_supers()' most often just generates useless wake-ups and wastes power.
I am trying to make all file-systems independent of '->write_super()' and plan
to remove 'sync_supers()' and '->write_super()' completely once there are no
more users.
