Hi Rafael!

Well, the kernel bugtracker is still down and I just like to post my
experience with kernel (x64) v3.1-rc8/9 + patches. My machine is a
MacBookPro, doomed with 4GB RAM running debian.

Bug #1

on the way to hibernate, machine hangs on

"PM: Preallocating image memory..."

this patch worked for me now for weeks:
"[PATCH] PM / Freezer: Freeze filesystems while freezing processes (v2)"
https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/9/24/77

I was able to reproduce this bug with virtualbox and tested the patch ~40
cycles.

Bug#2

on resume from hibernate, hard reset (x64 only):
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=131653513414314&w=2

With this patch I haven't got this issue again the last weeks.

I wasn't able to reproduce this bug with virtualbox.





I only got one pm-hibernate issue. Last line:

Disabling non-boot CPUs ...

This time I've enabled debug hung task :)

schedule_timeout
...
workqueue_cpu_callback
notifier_call_chain
...
__cpu_notify
_cpu_down
printk
disable_nonboot_cpus
hibernation_snapshot
hibernate
...

Any other idea besides the possibility it's caused by evil earth
radiation, isn't it?


Gruss,
chris
