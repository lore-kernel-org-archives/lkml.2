Actually, at this stage, you don't need any algorithms as no data is
permitted out.  Yes, we need the ability to queue the data, but we can
just as easily queue it to the socket as to the association.

Well, COOKIE-ECHOED state is probably better, since we are allowed
to send 1 DATA with a COOKIE-ECHO chunk, as well as with COOKIE-ACK.

Agreed.

Ok.  Looking forward to the next version.
