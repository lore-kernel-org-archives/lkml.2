This patch doesn't make any sense whatsoever. You can't know why a system
call was blocked by a seccomp filter, assuming it's always because of the
system call number is wrong.

Also, you don't check if an allowed system call is changed into a denied
one, so this doesn't protect against ptracers bypassing seccomp filters.

And one of the main points of PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP events was that it's
useful for cases that can't be handled or decided by the seccomp filter.
Then taking away the ability to change the syscall number makes it a lot
less useful.

Either do the seccomp test before or after ptrace, or both, but please
don't introduce ad hoc checks like this.

Greetings,

Indan
