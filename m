Thanks for putting up an example we can now speak more specifically.
(And saved me the time to actually look at code)
I'll first comment on your code below and I have some questions, please
see if I understood you correctly. Later below I'll try to explain what I
meant.

release_completion is only to be used by del_object!

This one is put on the kobj.release Right?

I don't see the unregister of the object_x.kobj, where do
you do this one in x_release or del_object below?

This put might not be the last put on the object, IOs in flight
and/or open files might have extra reference on the object.
We release our initial ref, and below wait for all operations
to complete. (Is there a matter of timeout like files not closing?)

Right?

One possibility (There are others)

3. struct object_x {
	...
	struct kref kref;
	struct kobject kobj;
	struct completion *release_completion;
};

Every body takes kref_put(&object_x.kref) and  kref_get(&object_x.kref)
I hope you have x_get/x_put, Yes?

static void x_kref_release(struct kref *kref)
{
	struct object_x *x = container_of(kref, struct object_x, kref);

	complete_all(&x->release_completion);
}

static void x_obj_release(struct kobject *kobj)
{
	struct object_x *x = container_of(kobj, struct object_x, kobj);

	kfree(x);
}

int x_put(struct object_x *x)
{
	return kref_put(&x->kref, x_kref_release);
}

void del_object(struct object_x *x)
{
	DECLARE_COMPLETION_ONSTACK(completion);

	...
	x->release_completion = &completion;
	x_put(x)
	wait_for_completion(&completion);
	kobject_put(&x->kobj);
}

Or

4. Exactly Like 3 but without the extra kref member
   Only x_put() changes and x_kref_release() now receives
   an x_object

int x_put(struct object_x *x)
{
	if (kobject_put(&x->kobj) == 1)
		// Like above [3] x_kref_release()
		x_kref_release(x);
}

Note that in 4 you don't actually have a kref member, and that you have
one extra ref on kobj from the beginning. In del_object above the first
x_put(x) makes it possible to reach the "1" count and then the final
kobject_put(&x->kobj); frees the object.
(You need to be carfull with [4] because it must have a refcount==2 before
you expose it to any IO or sysfs.)

So this is what I meant.

Boaz
