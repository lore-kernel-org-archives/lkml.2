I'm aware of this.  What I meant was that I don't know of any real-world 
ATAPI hardware needing the protocol quirks handling in SCSI.

Indeed!  Though code savings are smaller using this method..

Subject: [PATCH] scsi: make scsi_devinfo table content optional

Add CONFIG_SCSI_QUIRKS config option (default y and dependent
on EMBEDDED config option) to allow disabling of the default
scsi_devinfo table content.

The output code size savings are ~7.5k for CONFIG_SCSI_QUIRKS=n
(as measured on x86-64):

CONFIG_SCSI_QUIRKS=y:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   5965    5520     288   11773    2dfd drivers/scsi/scsi_devinfo.o

CONFIG_SCSI_QUIRKS=n:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   3740      48     288    4076     fec drivers/scsi/scsi_devinfo.o
