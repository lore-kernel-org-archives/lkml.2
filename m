I think I didn't make myself clear.
I don't mean we should intercept the mmap system call.

I mean we could intercept the internal kernel function do_mmap_pgoff.

This is used by the mmap system call but also (and more importantly) by the
execve system call and the uselib system call.

So any attempt to map a file and execute the code in that file - whether via
exec or via mapping a shared object - will go through do_mmap_pgoff.

So if we disable do_mmap_pgoff() requests which ask for execute permission
when a setuid has caused RLIMIT_NPROC to be exceeded, then we catch every
attempt to run the user's code as the user.

I won't catch a situation where an interpreter is already loaded into the
root-owned process and the setuid is followed by loading a script and running
that, it is isn't perfect.  But I think it is more general than just trapping
in execve.
