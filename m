 From the trace I posted, this stack trace below is being
called with the void *data object already freed.

One way for this to happen would be to have rpc_exit_task call task->tk_ops->rpc_call_done
more than once (I believe).  Two calls to rpc_exit_task could do that, and since the
rpc_exit_task method is assigned to tk_action, I *think* the race I mention above could cause
rpc_exit_task to be called twice.
