No problem.

Things are quite similar. Startup goes like:

<detected a onboard sata ports>
scsi: waiting for bus probes to complete...
Refined TSC...
Switched to clocksource tsc
<pause here>
udevd[...]: timeout: killing '/sbin/modprobe -b ...' (lots of these, so much 
that I hit scroll lock so I can see the kernel messages as they come up)
scsi 0:0:0:0: megasas: RESET cmd=12 retries=0
megasas: [ 0] waiting for 1 commands to complete
(many more waiting messages)
<hung task kworker/u:4>
Call Trace:
  [<ffffffff810641d0>] ? async_synchronize_cookie_domain+0xb2/...c
  [<ffffffff8105f583>] ? add_wait_queue+0x3c/0x3c
  ....
megasas: [55] waiting for 1 commands to complete
....
megasas: [175] waiting for 1 commands to complete
megasas: moving cmd[0]:ffff880234bcb940:0:ffff88002339beec0 the defer queue as 
internal
megaraid_sas: FW detected to be in faultstate, restarting it...
ADP_RESET_GEN2: HostDiag=a0
(10s wait)
megaraid_sas: FW restarted successfully,initializing next stage...
megaraid_sas: HBA recovery state machine,state 2 starting...
(30s wait)
megasas: Waiting for FW to come to ready state
megasas: FW now in ready state
megaraid_sas: command ffff880234bcb940, ffff8802339beec0:0detected to be pending 
while HBA reset
megasas: ffff880234bcb940 scsi cmd [12]detected on the internal queue, issue 
again.
megasas: reset successful
scsi: 0:0:0:0: megasas: RESET cmd=12 retries 0
megaraid_sas: no pending cmds after reset
megasas: reset successful
(20s wait)
(device offlined message here, missed it this time)
(detected all sata devices)

And it stalled there.
