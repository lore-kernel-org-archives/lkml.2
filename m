Well, what all this means is the SATL in the USB device is implemented
wrongly.  Since USB devices only preset SCSI interfaces, that's what we
have to believe.

hdparm when used correctly sends an ATA inquiry command wrapped in an
ATA_12 or ATA_16 SCSI command.  A large number of legacy SATLs are known
to crash on these commands.

Are you sure the ATA command is reporting correctly?  A write back cache
is a remarkably silly thing to enable for a USB device because they're
highly likely to be surprise ejected which powers the device down.

Well that's a nastily complex problem.  It really needs to be
whitelisted in the USB stack, but if every drive is doing it, that's
quite a task.

The question becomes how do we detect in a SCSI fashion that the device
has a write back cache if none of the standard SCSI mechanisms reports
it?
