There is a difference from a sysadmin standpoint: a sysadmin knows that
certain containers have Linux distro userlands for i386 and certain
others for x86-64, so he/she can configure things accordingly.  Even if
a customer using one of those containers installs extra software
packages, this extra software will work just fine as long as it's for
the same ABI.  The same doesn't hold true for sys_oldstat versus
sys_stat, etc.

I don't mind having a general filtering facility if it gets accepted
into the kernel (somehow Will's patch is not applied yet), and I don't
mind optimizing it to the point where it's not any slower for the "all
syscalls permitted but not all ABIs are" case.  I suspect that the
result of such optimizations will be similar to having these things
implemented separately, though - but I could be wrong.

So how do we proceed from here?  Start by getting Will's patch applied?
