Please use the "From:" line correctly, as stated in
Documentation/SubmittingPatches:

The "from" line must be the very first line in the message body,
and has the form:

        From: Original Author <author@example.com>

The "from" line specifies who will be credited as the author of the
patch in the permanent changelog.  If the "from" line is missing,
then the "From:" line from the email header will be used to determine
the patch author in the changelog.


I think you are using git format-patch to generate those patches, please supply
--author=<author> to git commit when you commit them to your local
tree. (or git am
if the patches you received already had the correct From: line.)

Thanks.
