Hi Vivek,
can we introduce a group think time check in cfq? say in a group the
last queue is backed for the group and the queue is a non-idle queue, if
the group think time is big, we don't allow the group idle and preempt
could happen. The fsync thread is a non-idle queue with Corrado's patch,
this allows fast group switch.

Thanks,
Shaohua
