I also tried to understand what lockdep was saying, but
Documentation/lockdep-design.txt is not too helpful.
I think 'CLASS'-ON-R / -ON-W means that this lock was 'ON' / held
while 'CLASS' (HARDIRQ, SOFTIRQ, RECLAIM_FS) happend and that makes
this lock unsafe for these contexts. IN-'CLASS'-R / -W seems to be
'lock taken in context 'CLASS'.
A note that 'CLASS'-ON-? means 'CLASS'-unsafe in there would be helpful to me...

Wrt. above interrupt output: I think lockdep doesn't really know about
RECLAIM_FS and threats it as another interrupt. I think that output
should have been something like this:
        CPU0                    CPU1
        ----                    ----
   lock(&(&ip->i_lock)->mr_lock/1);
                                <Allocation enters reclaim>
                                lock(sb_internal);
                                lock(&(&ip->i_lock)->mr_lock/1);
   <Allocation enters reclaim>
     lock(sb_internal);

Entering reclaim on CPU1 would mean that CPU1 would not enter reclaim
again, so the reclaim-'interrupt' would be disabled.
And instead of interrupts disrupting the normal codeflow on CPU0 it
would be 'interrupted' be instead of doing a normal allocation, it
would 'interrupt' the allocation to reclaim memory.
print_irq_lock_scenario() would need to be taught to print a slightly
different message for reclaim-'interrupts'.

I will try your patch, but as I do not have a reliable reproducer to
create this lockdep report, I can't really verify if this fixes it.
But I will definitely mail you, if it happens again with this patch.

Thanks, Torsten
