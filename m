Conceptually yes we could - I don't suppose we ever will as keeping
separate vmas for stack and RSE stack defends against underflow in
a program that has totally messed up.  But I can save 4 bytes of
source code and drop the "else".

This mask might be redundant ... I didn't look at the call
sequence, but I've observed that "address" happens to be page
aligned in all my tests.

Yes, that works too.

Coding revised version now.
