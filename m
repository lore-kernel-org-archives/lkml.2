Subject: [RFC][PATCH 5/9 v2] move charges to root at rmdir if use_hierarchy
 is unset

Now, at removal of cgroup, ->pre_destroy() is called and move charges
to the parent cgroup. A major reason of -EBUSY returned by ->pre_destroy()
is that the 'moving' hits parent's resource limitation. It happens only
when use_hierarchy=0. This was a mistake of original design.(it's me...)

Considering use_hierarchy=0, all cgroups are treated as flat. So, no one
cannot justify moving charges to parent...parent and children are in
flat configuration, not hierarchical.

This patch modifes to move charges to root cgroup at rmdir/force_empty
if use_hierarchy==0. This will much simplify rmdir() and reduce error
in ->pre_destroy.

   Typical use case of this interface is that calling this before rmdir().
   Because rmdir() moves all pages to parent, some out-of-use page caches can be
   moved to the parent. If you want to avoid that, force_empty will be useful.
