That would make it impossible to export the filesystem with NFSv2 and
v3. They do rely on ctime checking for certain operations (e.g. deciding
when to invalidate access and acl caches). NFSv4 needs this too if the
filesystem has no dedicated change attribute.

Still, I suppose the market for exporting the same filesystem with both
NFS and Samba is limited...
