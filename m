Currently, all nfsd kthreads use memory for their kernel stack and
various initial data from a _single_ node, even if you use
sunrpc.pool_mode=pernode  (or percpu)

With my patch, we make sure each thread gets its stack from its local
node.

Check commit 94dcf29a11b3d20a (kthread: use kthread_create_on_node()) to
see how this strategy already was adopted for ksoftirqd, kworker,
migration, and pktgend kthreads.

I only have small machines here (two nodes), so I cannot post
significative bench results, but it seems quite obvious to expect a good
increase.
