I think this is what Andi meant that you'll always race with time and
that version counters are the only real solution here.

You should not. However, there have been bugs in the past, and there
will probably be a few more in the future.

There are also theoretical issues with SMP systems where the TSCs are
not perfectly synced, but the window for those races should be small
(ie: smaller then can be detected - otherwise we'll throw out the TSC).
