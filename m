There are two easy ways to fix this problem.  Turn off the inline
extents (max_inline=0) or allow splitting of the inline extents.  I
didn't put in the splitting simply because the complexity was high while
the benefits were low (in comparison with just turning off the inline
extents).

Are you basing all of this on inline extents?  The other extents of
variable size are more flexible (taking up the room in the leaf), but
they can also easy be split during balancing.
