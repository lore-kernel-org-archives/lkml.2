FWIW this is what the btrfs {START,WAIT}_SYNC ioctls do.  Because it ties 
into btrfs' transactions, there's an additional semantic that operations 
after the START_SYNC are not included in the committed state (this time 
around, at least).  Absent that (which I'm not sure maps cleanly onto many 
other file systems currently, and is of limited value when not used in 
concert with btrfs snapshots), I'm not sure a wait flag is helpful.  Is it 
any different than an application doing the syncfs() in a separate thread?
