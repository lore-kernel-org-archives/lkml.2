OK, this is needed for 6/6. I still can't say I like this change (and
6/6 too ;), and it is not enough.

If we spawn the new init because we called sys_unshare(CLONE_NEWPID)
in the past (Eric, imho this can't be the really nice idea) we should
also set TASK_UNKILLABLE at least.

IOW. Not only this hides CLONE_NEWPID from grep, unshare() also hides
it from paths which should know about this flag.

I'd rather prefer the straightforward implementation of unshare(NEWPID)
which merely adds SIGNAL_THE_NEXT_FORK_SHOULD_USE_CLONE_NEWPID flag
to current->signal->flags. Yes, this is very ugly too.

Oleg.
