In more general terms, the filesystem should be able to require: try
another read different regarding the previous ones. The term are
important because we should differentiate the case of "wrong data from
disk1, read from disk0" and "wrong data from disk0 read disk1". I prefer
thinking the field as bitmap. Every bit represent a different way of
read. So it is possible to reuse to track which "kind of read" was
already used.

After a 2nd read, the block layer should:
	a) redo the read if possible, otherwise FAIL
	b) pass the data to the filesystem
	c) if the filesystem accepts the new data, replace the wrong
	   data with the correct one or mark the block as broken.
	d) inform the userspace/filesystem of the result
