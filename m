What other Unix systems actually implement revoke() in this manner?  I
looked at the BSDs a while ago, and they only do revoke() on a tty
character device node.

So are there other examples of someone actually implementing this in a
manner that works and is usable?  If so, pointers would be greatly
appreciated, as well as the userspace side that takes advantage of such
a system call.

That can be implemented today without the need for the userspace
revoke() call to be added, right?  Just propagate around the device
disconnect message that the disk controller driver already knows about.
