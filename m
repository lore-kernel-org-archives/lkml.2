OK, at this point one of us is confused, and I'm not sure which.

Is the "same location" that you're referring to the current_nfsd_time?

Neil's suggestion is to only modify current_nfsd_time on nfsd getattr,
*not* on the write operation that modifies the file data.

Or are you talking about something else?
