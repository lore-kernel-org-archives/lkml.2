OK, I can give that another try.  Al, does that sound like the more
sensible choice to you?


Uh, that means ditching some work in my public git tree.  Which I
haven't rebased in years.  So, a stupid process question; would you
rather I:

	- continue to be strict about rebasing and apply a bunch of
	  reverts?
	- ditch it and start over?

#1 looks like a mess to me, so I guess #2's my default.  Probably nobody
will notice but me.

Al called this all "highly non-trivial":

I don't know who'd have the cycles.
