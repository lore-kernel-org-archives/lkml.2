For union mounts, we will want to skip the truncate too (or else
insinuate ourselves into do_truncate() - less attractive).  This is
because we want to only copy up the bytes that are not being
truncated, instead of copying up the file contents and then throwing
them away.

What's the timing on the do_last() change?  Do you know what branch it
will be in?

Thanks,
