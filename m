I don't know...  The thing is, we mostly do that to make life easier for
fsck in case of crash.  Other than that, there's no reason to play with
link count of that sucker at all.  The question is, do we really want
such rename() interrupted by dirty shutdown to result in what looks like two
legitimate links to that inode without any indications of what had happened?
Note that fsck (at least on ext2) will correct link counts anyway and if
nothing else, we probably want some noise pointing to the inode in question...

IOW, maybe it's better to rip these inc/dec for old_inode out and replace
them with mark_inode_dirty() in place where we currently do dec.  Comments?
