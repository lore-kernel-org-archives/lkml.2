Wait is my example above possible?  Or does child_user_ns3's range need
to be a subset of child_user_ns2's?

In which case it would be

       child_user_ns1  [100000-199999]
       child_user_ns2  [100000-199999]
         child_user_ns3  [120000-129999]

Would that not require intervention from the init_user_ns?  In my
example above (let's add that ns2 is owned by kuid.uid=1000 in
init_user_ns), root in child_user_ns2 cannot map kuid.val=0 or
kuid.val=1000 into ns3 because 0 and 1000 are not in the range
100000-199999.  So there is no uid in child_user_ns3 which is able
to spoof uid=0 in child_user_ns1.
