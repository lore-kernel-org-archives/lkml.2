Hi Linus, 

Please pull from:

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git for_linus

to get the latest bug fixes and improvements for the 2.6.36 merge
window.

As you will see from the patch, there are a few files outside of the
ext4/jbd2 directories.  These were coordinated with the OCFS2 and XFS
folks.  In the case of XFS, there was a change made to the direct I/O
code by Christoph Hellwig which had to be coordinated with XFS and ext4
file systems.  So that we could do proper testing on both of our
respective trees, I thought we could best handle by simply having
exactly the same patch dropped into the XFS and ext4 trees, and that git
would handle the merging correctly.  As it turns out I was wrong
(although I'm a bit puzzled about why).

For that reason, the diff stat and the shortlog message below are were
taken between v2.6.35-rc3 and the 'next' branch.  In order to make the
the test merge with your upstream master work out correctly, without
some very confusing conflicts, I did a merge of 40e2e97 into the
for_linus branch.  This resulted in a conflict, which once I resolved,
turned into a resulted nothing showing up when I do a "git diff-tree -cc
HEAD".  (If you do a "git show bbe09ca" you'll see is a null merge with
no diffs.)  And you'll also see that diffs from commit 40e2e97 (from the
xfs tree) and 552ef80 (from the ext4 tree) are identical.

So by merging 40e2e97 into the for_linus tree, and manually assuring
that this merge was resolved by using the ext4 tree's chunks for
fs/ext4/inode.c, it makes the test merge with your upstream go smoothly.

Which is hopefully what you want.  If you want exactly what is shown
below, you can also pull the "next" branch, which omits the merge, and
then you can deal with the merge conflict by hand.  The results should
be the same either way.

Sorry for the confusion...
