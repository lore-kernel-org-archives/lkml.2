Well, it has never worked before either, so I wouldn't call it a
"workaround", more of a "insane subsystems do user-mode helpers for
crazy small things, and at crazy times. Stop them from wasting our
time and effort at those crazy times when we know they would fail
anyway".

I think just not calling user-mode when user-mode isn't ready is a real fix.

The fact that the device models send an absolutely *insane* amount of
events for everything, and don't track "this is the bootup device
scan" on their own is kind of sad, but it's how they roll. This fixes
it at a core level, so that the device layer doesn't have to track the
"am I booting, or is this a dynamic event?" at all.
