You missed my point. I meant unintentional bugs, heavy load, mis-configuration
Administrator mistake. If the admin *wants*  /bin/rm -fr / that's
fine he does not need me.

That's fine. I will fail totally gracefully, and nothing will happen. I like this
example if the system is under heavy load and there is no memory and the
iscsi auto-login takes more then 15 second (Settable by module param) then I'd
rather fail the login and revert to plain NFS-MDS IO, instead of the direct osd-target
IO. Believe me.

No I need to wait for the application to finish the iscsi login before
I can continue IO to the target. Otherwise what's the point.

As I said that's completely fine. Please give me a bit of Credit.
The IO in question would revert to NFS-MDS IO. Since the login succeeded
eventually, the next time the device is looked for it will be found and future
IO will be fast direct to storage. Perfectly fine.

They can race as much as they want.

I did that actually. But I would like not to be dependent on it. I would like
the Kernel to be independent and simple timeout and recover, as you said
even the very first execv can timeout in an overloaded system. In that case
I'd like to fail as well and revert to slower IO.

We did that here:
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.nfs/47921/focus=48182

But again I'd prefer Kernel independence in those matters
