I really appreciate this and I like it since although the root-cause

And it's great good thing that we can directly talk to the involved devs

Yes, the downside of running Gentoo unstable. But even the "stable" tree

Nevertheless, your reply eased my mind to a great extend and I'm
thankful for it.
Time for bed now :)
