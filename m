I understand what you have in mind, but I still think this the wrong
approach for the default cases.  For an in-kernel iscsi-target capable
of changing any aspect of the control plane on the fly, this type of
split is problematic to support and maintain and does not actually buy
us anything for the default cases.

Sure it does.  It means the difference between if the
'required-to-implement' cases can be exposed via configfs to a native
python object library and shell, or if we need to have an external
daemon + configuration that has to be kept in sync between the two,
parse external configuration files, et al.

With the current design, the NodeACLs + authentication are available
directly as part of the rtslib python object library, and python code
including rtslib can reference all aspects of the initiator
configuration directly.  Breaking this up to an external daemon and
configuration is a step backwards for the default cases from the
perspective of rtslib, and making it work with an external
configuration / daemon for the NodeACLs + default authentication case is
an hack compared to how iscsi-target functionality is exposed to
application level progammers via rtslib today.
