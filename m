Not sure if it is related but we saw similar issue with MMC driver on
Cortex-A9 MP core. I was seeing similar weird issues with EXT3 and 
everything use to be fine with EXT2.

All those errors you mentioned use to come and at times whole FS
Use to get corrupted.

It was root-caused to MMC driver which uses DMA engine for TX/RX. The
issue was mainly with writes and hence EXT3 was having issue which does
journaling and hence more writes.
There was a memory write barrier missing before the DMA descriptors 
are handed over to DMA controller.
