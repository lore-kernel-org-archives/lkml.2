commit 176e21ee2ec89cae8d45cf1a850ea45a45428fb8

    SUNRPC: Support for RPC over AF_LOCAL transports
    
    TI-RPC introduces the capability of performing RPC over AF_LOCAL
    sockets.  It uses this mainly for registering and unregistering
    local RPC services securely with the local rpcbind, but we could
    also conceivably use it as a generic upcall mechanism.
    
    This patch provides a client-side only implementation for the moment.
    We might also consider a server-side implementation to provide
    AF_LOCAL access to NLM (for statd downcalls, and such like).
    
    Autobinding is not supported on kernel AF_LOCAL transports at this
    time.  Kernel ULPs must specify the pathname of the remote endpoint
    when an AF_LOCAL transport is created.  rpcbind supports registering
    services available via AF_LOCAL, so the kernel could handle it with
    some adjustment to ->rpcbind and ->set_port.  But we don't need this
    feature for doing upcalls via well-known named sockets.
    
    This has not been tested with ULPs that move a substantial amount of
    data.  Thus, I can't attest to how robust the write_space and
    congestion management logic is.

commit 7402ab19cdd5943c7dd4f3399afe3abda8077ef5
Author: Chuck Lever <chuck.lever@oracle.com>

    SUNRPC: Use AF_LOCAL for rpcbind upcalls
    
    As libtirpc does in user space, have our registration API try using an
    AF_LOCAL transport first when registering and unregistering.
    
    This means we don't chew up privileged ports, and our registration is
    bound to an "owner" (the effective uid of the process on the sending
    end of the transport).  Only that "owner" may unregister the service.
    
    The kernel could probe rpcbind via an rpcbind query to determine
    whether rpcbind has an AF_LOCAL service. For simplicity, we use the
    same technique that libtirpc uses: simply fail over to network
    loopback if creating an AF_LOCAL transport to the well-known rpcbind
    service socket fails.
    
    This means we open-code the pathname of the rpcbind socket in the
    kernel.  For now we have to do that anyway because the kernel's
    RPC over AF_LOCAL implementation does not support autobind.  That may
    be undesirable in the long term.

    NFS: Revert NFSROOT default mount options
    
    Marek Belisko <marek.belisko@gmail.com> reports that recent attempts
    to fix regressions in NFSROOT have broken his configuration:
    
    > After update from 2.6.38-rc8 to 2.6.38 is mounting rootfs over nfs not possible.
    > Log:
    > VFS: Mounted root (nfs filesystem) on device 0:14.
    > Freeing init memory: 132K
    > nfs: server 10.146.1.21 not responding, still trying
    > nfs: server 10.146.1.21 not responding, still trying

    > NFS: NFSROOT should default to "proto=udp"
    >
    > I've tested on mini2440 board (DM9000, static IP).
    > Is there some missing option or something else to be checked?
    
    An examination of a network trace captured during the failure shows
    that the mount is actually succeeding, but that the client is not
    seeing READ replies larger than 16KB.  This could be a local packet
    filtering issue on the client, but we didn't troubleshoot this
    further because of the reported "git bisect" result.
    
    Last fall we removed the ad hoc mount option parser in
    fs/nfs/nfsroot.c in favor of using the main parser in fs/nfs/super.c
    (see commit 56463e50 "NFS: Use super.c for NFSROOT mount option
    parsing").  That commit changed the default NFSROOT mount options to
    be the same as those employed by user space mounts.
    
    As it turns out, these new default mount options are not tolerated by
    many embedded systems.  So far these problems have been due to
    specific behavior of certain embedded NICs.  The NFS community does
    not have such hardware on hand for running tests.
    
    Commit 53d47375 recently introduced a clean way to specify default
    mount options for NFSROOT, so we can now easily restore the
    traditional defaults for NFSROOT:
    
       vers=2,udp,rsize=4096,wsize=4096
    
    This should revert the new default NFSROOT mount options introduced
    with commit 56463e50.

    SUNRPC: Rename xs_encode_tcp_fragment_header()
    
    Clean up: Use a more generic name for xs_encode_tcp_fragment_header();
    it's appropriate to use for all stream transport types.  We're about
    to add new stream transport.
    
    Also, move it to a place where it is more easily shared amongst the
    various send_request methods.  And finally, replace the "htonl" macro
    invocation with its modern equivalent.
