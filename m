It survived.  I hit at least one mm bug, but I really don't think it's
a problem with your code.  (I have not tried this workload on Linux
3.7 at all before.  It normally runs on 3.5.)  The box in question is
ext4 on LVM on dm-crypt on (hardware) RAID 5 on hpsa, which should not
need stable pages.

The majority of the data written (that wasn't unlinked before it was
dropped from cache) was checksummed when written and verified later.
Most of this data was written using mmap.  This workload hammers the
vm concurrently in several threads, and it frequently stalls when
stable pages are enabled, so it's probably exercising the code
decently well.
