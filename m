The uuid_le/be_gen() in lib/uuid.c has set UUID variants to be DCE,
that is done in __uuid_gen_common() with "b[8] = (b[8] & 0x3F) | 0x80".

To deal with random number generation issue, how about use
get_random_bytes() in __uuid_gen_common()?

uuid_be complies RFC4122, it uses internet byte order.  But EFI uses
little endian.
