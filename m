Hi

My first thought is that this is because of how we are caching the result of a readdir now.  We are storing the name of each directory entry as part of the cache, and this requires allocating memory for each string.  These are freed on unmount (see nfs_readdir_clear_array() in fs/nfs/dir.c), but you probably don't want to unmount your root filesytem...
