Hello Linus!

Here is the current set of target-pending fixes headed for v3.6-final.

Please go ahead and pull from:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/nab/target-pending.git master

The main parts of this series include bug-fixes from Paolo Bonzini to
address an use-after-free bug in pSCSI sense exception handling, along
with addressing some long-standing bugs wrt the handling of zero-length
SCSI CDB payloads also specific to pSCSI pass-through device backends.

A heads up that the following patch of the series:

target: go through normal processing for zero-length PSCSI commands
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/nab/target-pending.git;a=commitdiff;h=306c11b28d7bb85a7adda741798a2b6b60dd305a

does not compile due to a minor syntax error in the original patch, that
unfortunately had already been pushed to target-pending/master before
being caught by Wu's 0-day build script.

So it's ultimately my fault for not catching this during review +
testing, and to avoid this in the future if I don't have the immediate
time to compile test each patch headed into master, they will now go
into target-pending/queue (for a day or two) so that the 0-day build
scripts can do their thing and notify us of bi-sectable trouble ahead of
time.

Please let me know if you'd prefer a re-spin branch to address this, or
if you'd rather fix this up on your end before pushing.

Thank you,

--nab
