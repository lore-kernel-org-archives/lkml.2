I'll be submitting the below.

The bug's been there for a really long time and we're getting late into
the release cycle so I'll probably just save it for 3.1 (but it'll go to
stable as well then).

    svcrpc: fix list-corrupting race on nfsd shutdown
    
    After commit 3262c816a3d7fb1eaabce633caa317887ed549ae "[PATCH] knfsd:
    split svc_serv into pools", svc_delete_xprt (then svc_delete_socket) no
    longer removed its xpt_ready (then sk_ready) field from whatever list it
    was on, noting that there was no point since the whole list was about to
    be destroyed anyway.
    
    That was mostly true, but forgot that a few svc_xprt_enqueue()'s might
    still be hanging around playing with the about-to-be-destroyed list, and
    could get themselves into trouble writing to freed memory if we left
    this xprt on the list after freeing it.
    
    (This is actually functionally identical to a patch made first by Ben
    Greear, but with more comments.)
