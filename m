It's better if you read the code. :)

Ok, It try to answer. Please correct me, if I'm wrong.

rpc_pipefs is a userland/kernel interface (I don't see kernel-kernel
usecases, but it's possible, I guess).
There is client dir (nfs/clntX) in rpc_pipefs for every sunrpc client.
Both client and server (see fs/nfsd/nfs4callback.c) can create sunrpc
client. So we rpc_pipefs on both side.
rpc_pipefs uses not only on mount time. See old idmapper, for example.
