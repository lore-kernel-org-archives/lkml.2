So I'm curious --- have you actually benchmarked a performance
decrease?  What sort of hardware are you using?

The readahead should be changing a 4k read to a 8k read with a value
of 1, which shouldn't take a much of a difference to a HDD.

I can apply this patch, but is it really making a difference for you?
