  Could you get the filesystem image with: e2image -r /dev/sdb2 buggy-image
bzip2 it and make it available somewhere? Maybe I could guess something
from the way the filesystem gets corrupted.
  Oh, and also overwrite the partition with zeros before calling mkfs to make
the analysis simpler.

  Funny. Not sure how that could happen...
