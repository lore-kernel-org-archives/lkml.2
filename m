Fair enough.  So for the sake on continuity I am happy to rename
functions that are available externally to frontends with a target_*()
prefix and primary data structures to a tcm_* prefix.

So at this point only the backend code still lives in drivers/target,
while everything related to frontends resides in
drivers/target/$TCM_MODNAME.  Now moving IBLOCK, FILEIO, PSCSI and
RAMDISK .c and .h files into drivers/target/backend/ to resolve this
item..

<nod>  I will follow up with an audit of this code, most of which is
coming from target_core_transport.c

Yes, the documentation that I have been promising will help clear this
up.  target_core_transport.h contains the struct se_subsystem_api that
is used for backend code, and target_core_fabric_ops.h contains the
struct target_core_fabric_ops used by frontend drivers.  There is still
a handful of other includes required for frontend drivers, but I did
spend time on this recently to clean up what is made available in
include/target.
