Yes the previously one was broken since it was not a global uniq exec_id,
it was designed for threads tracking.

The current one is a global exec_id with uniq IDs, incremented on each
do_execve_common() call.

For the fork one yes exec_id will match but we have the permission
checks (ptrace) at each syscall, so even if two processes share the same
exec_id the ptrace check should fail.

Yes it's predictable, but I don't see how you could pass the fd to another
extern privileged process without failing at the exec_id check.
