Why would this be a problem? 

I mean, why would getting a copy of an otherwise invisible surface be a
performance sensitive path? If the compositor needs the surface it would
make it visible and send the XDamage once and keep it visible henceforth
until the time it again becomes invisible, at which point you have to
stop updates again.

The normal case is where things are visible and things are kept
up-to-date, that doesn't change.

Yes, and a ball is round (unless you're a USA-ian, in which case they're
ovoid), what's your point?
