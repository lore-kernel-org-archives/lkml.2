Pages have always been modifiable in flight.  The OS guarantees they'll
be rewritten, so the drivers can drop them if it detects the problem.
This is identical to the iscsi checksum issue (iscsi adds a checksum
because it doesn't trust TCP/IP and if the checksum is generated in
software, there's time between generation and page transmission for the
alteration to occur).  The solution in the iscsi case was not to
complain if the page is still marked dirty.
