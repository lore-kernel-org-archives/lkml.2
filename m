Apologies for not making the motivation for these patches more clear. 
The first two of these three patches really only exist as support for 
the last one, which fixes the deadlock that I was really concerned 
about. That was the same motivation for the earlier 11 patches I sent. 
While the other patches may fix some real bugs on .27, that wasn't my 
goal. So I won't be offering to send any more ext4-related fixes to 
.27.y either unless it is for something really serious.

I considered carefully whether to send the patches as they are now, but 
the alternative would be to re-work the fix in the last patch, which I 
didn't want to tackle, for fear of getting it wrong.

The concern is understandable, and I agree that .27.y is no longer a 
good candidate for receiving noncritical ext4 fixes.

Thanks for the tip. I will get xfstests running and report the results 
in a few days.
