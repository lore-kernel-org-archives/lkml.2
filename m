I'm saying it's way too narrow scoped and inflexible to be a kernel
feature.  Kernel features should be like the basic tools, you know,
hammers, saws, drills and stuff.  In-kernel CR is more like an over
complicated food processor which usually sits in the top drawer after
first several runs,

which can do all of the above, a lot of which can be achieved in
less messy way than putting the whole thing inside the kernel.

What does that have anything to do with the kernel?  If you want
post-link cache, implement it in ld.so where it belongs.  That's like
using food processor to mix cement.

Continuing the same line of thought.  It _CAN_ be used to do that in a
convoluted way but there are better ways to solve those problems.

Yeah, exactly, so just do it inside the established ABI extending
where it makes sense.  No reason to add a whole separate set.

Thanks.
