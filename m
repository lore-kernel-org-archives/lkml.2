Subject: [RFC/PATCH] mptscsih: Set DRIVER_SENSE when sense data present
Date: Sun, 20 May 2012 07:32:49 -0700
Message-Id: <1337524369-8622-1-git-send-email-johunt@akamai.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 1.7.0.4

While looking into some drive errors on a few of our systems I noticed that
DRIVER_SENSE was not being set by mptscsih even though there was sense data
present. DRIVER_SENSE does eventually get set by scsi_finish_command() when
it detects the sense data. I won't pretend I'm an expert in this area, I'm
just looking for an explanation as to why the patch below or something like
it is not currently in the driver? Is it sufficient enough that we're detecting
this case later on in the scsi code?

Thanks
Josh

Currently when sense data is present only check condition is set. This
sets DRIVER_SENSE as well.
