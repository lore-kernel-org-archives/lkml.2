No. In the scenario you describe above, it will be

client: uid 600 <=> foo@REALM
server: foo@REALM <=> uid 500

The above _not_ work properly in the existing code... This kind of
situation is the whole reason for wanting to change the existing code.

With the existing code, the client will send numeric uid 600 as part of
the rpc-level AUTH_SYS authentication, and so the server will create
files with uid 600 irrespective of the foo@REALM idmapping at the NFSv4
level.
When the client later attempts to do a GETATTR on that file, the server
will then translate that uid 600 using the idmapper

server  uid 600 => bar@REALM
client  bar@REALM => uid 213412

IOW: This is exactly the situation where we want to use numeric uids
everywhere, so that the server returns a numeric uid 600 in the GETATTR.
In addition, if the client does a 'chown foo', it should send uid 600 in
the SETATTR request, which matches the uid 600 in the AUTH_SYS
authentication.

Or again: If I'm using AUTH_SYS, then I'm transmitting numeric uids/gids
as my authentication token, and so I want to use the same numeric
uids/gids to label my file ownership. The idmapper doesn't affect the
AUTH_SYS authentication token, and so mapping the NFS ownership to
trond@REALM is not useful and may instead result in wrong behaviour such
as in the situation described above.

When I use KerberosV principals ('kinit trond@REALM') as my
authentication token in an RPCSEC_GSS session, then I want to use the
same _string_ user trond@REALM to label my file ownership. The idmapper
is then used to map the abstract trond@REALM into a uid/gid that the
kernel can understand (and the actual value on the client/server is
irrelevant as long as it matches whatever the authentication token maps
to).
