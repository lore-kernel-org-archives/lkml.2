parasitism is fine for a slow-but-sure debugger but is not suitable
for checkpoint/restart.

The difficulty of checkpoint/restart is not that the task has
more information than the kernel. Quite the contrary. Most of
the "information" the task has that the kernel is not explicitly
aware of is encoded in the task's memory. So long as the kernel
faithfully restores memory and registers the task can know little 
the kernel doesn't already know.

One example of something the task knows that the kernel does not is
which pids it cares about. However, a parasitic thread capable
of checkpointing arbitrary processes won't know about these pids
either -- it would have to be designed to checkpoint *only* the
process it was injected into.

Furthermore, the kernel has information necessary for checkpoint/restart
that the task does not. The composition of an epoll set is one
example.

So ptrace is just the wrong interface to base checkpoint/restart on.
Pavel's approach, though I believe it is subtly flawed, is better.
