It _seems_ to be ARMv5 specific[1]. Uwe did some tests and figured out
that disabling dcache on ARMv5 "fixes" the problem, but
CONFIG_CPU_DCACHE_WRITETHROUGH isn't enough.

[1] Uwe fails to reproduce it on ARMv6. The ARMv6 has a L2 cache and
uses IIRC different instructions to flush the L1 caches. (please correct
me, if I'm wrong, ARM guys :)

cheers, Marc
