Ok, I'll grant that for stat() type calls, but I've just been focusing
on that as an example here. We'll need to do something similar for all
path based syscalls. What about things that require more than one round
trip -- e.g. chmod()?

So essentially you want to push all of the LOOKUP handling down into
the filesystems such that all ops are atomic_* or have an atomic_*
variant. That sounds like a very heavy-handed way to solve this.
