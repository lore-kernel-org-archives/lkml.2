In theory, yes.  But at some point we will be able to saturate them,
and then people want proportional I/O, light amounts of queueing, etc.

And I really don't want to reinvent that for every little device.  The
other problem is that we a single driver might driver totally different
types of devices, already today we have iSCSI or FC accessibly high
IOPS devices, there are good PCI-e flash devices masquerading as AHCI,
and my current problem is that the queue_lock really hurts me in
virtio-blk when using a PCIe flash device underneath.

So we really need some infrastructure that allows a generic interface
to the driver, and allow us to plug in merging, scheduling, queueing
on an as needed basis.

That is my long term plan - making request_lock suck a little less,
and improving the driver interface is a good first step, though.
