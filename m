This is one of the things that confuses me, actually.  Why is it that there are a number of people who want to use ext4 on 2.6.27?   Even the enterprise distro's have moved on; SLES 11 SP1 upgraded their users from 2.6.27 to 2.6.32, for example.  I wonder if it's time to start a new "stable anchor point" around 2.6.32, given that Ubuntu's latest Long-Term Stable (Lucid LTS) is based on 2.6.32, as is SLES 11 SP1.  The RHEL 6 beta is also based on 2.6.32.  (And I just spent quite a bit of time over the past week backporting a lot of ext4 bug fixes to 2.6.32.y :-)

If there are people who want to work on trying to backport more ext4 fixes to 2.6.27, they're of course free to do so.  I am really curious  as to *why*, though.
