Thanks for looking into the patch.
Yes, you are right. The situation is hypothetical.
We were checking about Ext4's behavior when it returns error at
different points in truncate/hole punch path and that's when we
stumbled on to this.
In real, we cannot re-produce this scenario without modifying Ext4's
code and hence an extra RFC added with the patch.
If you think that obtaining journal handle could never fail at mount
time, than please ignore this patch.

Right, using ext4_error() would have been a better choice than
explicitly setting RO flag.
I wonder why ext4_truncate does not clear the orphan_list in case of
failure to obtain journal handle unlike that of ext3_truncate?
We would not have to bother about explicitly clearing the orphan list
in the first place if we could just add a lable like out_notrans (as
in ext3)=>
 if (IS_ERR(handle))
                goto out_notrans;

 out_notrans:
        /*
         * Delete the inode from orphan list so that it doesn't stay there
         * forever and trigger assertion on umount.
         */
        if (inode->i_nlink)
                ext3_orphan_del(NULL, inode);

Ashish
