It seemed the patch[ ext4: in fiemap use FIEMAP_EXTENT_LAST flag for
last extent] (http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ext4/msg25698.html)
Lukas submitted on FIEMAP which ignores delayed extents beyond the
last allocated block.  e.g.  AAAHHHHDDDD
A - allocated, H - hole, D - delayed alloc, then the ending delayed
extent is ignored.
