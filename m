I figured that the price for the extra hashing isn't significant since hash_32
is just a multiplication and a shift.

I'll modify the code to calculate the key just once.

"Is hash_* good enough for our purpose?" - I was actually surprised that no one
raised that question during the RFC and assumed it was because everybody agreed
that it's indeed good enough.

I can offer the following: I'll write a small module that will hash 1...10000
into a hashtable which uses 7 bits (just like user_ns) and post the distribution
we'll get.

If the results of the above will be satisfactory we can avoid the discussion
about which hash function we should really be using. If not, I guess now is a
good time for that :)
