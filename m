Oh, for god's sake children.  Why does every LIO vs SCST discussion turn
into a pointless flameware over stuff no-one really cares about?  If
none of you has anything substantive to say: don't say it.

Since patches into SCSI go over the mailing list for review and
integration (and running checkpatch.pl on ... this would be a hint), I
don't really give a toss how they're generated.

It isn't yet ... your code still has to be reviewed properly.  My
preferred reviewer is currently honing his skills on a diet of raw beef
in Argentina, but hopefully he'll get around to it shortly.
