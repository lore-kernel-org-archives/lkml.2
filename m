Ok then. Keeping people from shooting themselves here sounds reasonable.
And I like the idea of exporting a filesystem only from once per network 
namespace. Looks like there should be a list of pairs "exported superblock - 
network namespace". And if superblock is exported already in other namespace, 
then export in new namespace have to be skipped (replaced?) with appropriate 
warning (error?) message shown in log.
Or maybe we even should deny starting of NFS server if one of it's exports is 
shared already by other NFS server "instance"?
But any of these ideas would be easy to implement in RAM, and thus it suits only 
for containers...
