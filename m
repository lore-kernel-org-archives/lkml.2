For this particular example, I think we'd better have a file in which
a task can poll and get woken up when the task limit has been reached.
Then that task can decide to freeze or whatever.

Thing is we have an ABI now and it has been there for a while now. Aren't
we stuck with it? I'm no big fan of that multiple hierarchies thing either
but now I fear we have to support it.

Another solution is to support a class of multi-bindable subsystems as in
this old patch from Paul:

	https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/7/1/578

It sounds to me more healthy to iterate only over subsystems in fork/exit.
We probably don't want to add a new iteration over cgroups themselves
on these fast path.
