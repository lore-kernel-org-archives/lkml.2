Yeah, good idea.  I had that ~2min after sending my report during
dinner, sorry :-\

This is an nfsroot of /home/ukl/nfsroot/tx28 which is a symlink to a
directory on a different partition.  I don't know the filesystem of my
homedir as it resides on a server I have no access to, but I asked the
admin, so I can follow up with this info later (I'd suspect ext3, too).
The real root directory is on ext3 (rw,noatime).

The serving nfs-server is Debian's nfs-kernel-server 1:1.2.2-1.
nfs-related kernel parameters are

	ip=dhcp root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=192.168.23.2:/home/ukl/nfsroot/tx28,v3,tcp

I hope this answers your questions.  If not, please ask.

I tried without the symlink and saw some different errors, e.g.

	starting splashutils daemon.../etc/rc.d/S00splashutils: line 50: //sbin/fbsplashd.static: Unknown error 521

(this is the init script that hung before) and

	[    6.160000] NFS: server 192.168.23.2 error: fileid changed
	[    6.160000] fsid 0:c: expected fileid 0x33590a4, got 0x4d11bedc

but no hang as before.  So maybe it's related to the symlink?  I don't
know if testing that further would help or just waste of my time, so
please let me know if I can help you and how.

Best regards
Uwe
