I understand your request for the kernel to print out these types of
names, but I'm still not sold on this being an issue that is the
kernel's to deal with at all.

Again, how would you handle multiple persistant names for the same
device being used at the same time?

And again, why not just fix the userspace tools?  That is trivial to do
so and again, could have been done by now in the years this has been
discussed.
