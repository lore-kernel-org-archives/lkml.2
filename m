I'm not quite saying that (though there is a temptation).  Some attributes
are initialised by the filesystem rather than by common code.  i_uid is a
simple example.  I have no problem with the filesystem initialising the
storage that is used for this well-known-EA to the current time at creation.
This would be part of what team-samba negotiated with FS developers.

If something is created in a different universe, then brought into this one -
when is its date of birth?  The moment of creation, or the moment of entry
into this universe?   If both universes have a common time line (altough
with a 10 year offset) then I guess the former, though I think it is a bit of
a philosophical point.... :-)

Yes, I suspect that would be ideal, and trivial for the fs to implement (it
has to initialise it to something after all).

i.e. I agree.
