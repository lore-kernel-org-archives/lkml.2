Subject: [PATCH 13/24] cfq-iosched: implement hierarchy-ready cfq_group charge scaling

Currently, cfqg charges are scaled directly according to cfqg->weight.
Regardless of the number of active cfqgs or the amount of active
weights, a given weight value always scales charge the same way.  This
works fine as long as all cfqgs are treated equally regardless of
their positions in the hierarchy, which is what cfq currently
implements.  It can't work in hierarchical settings because the
interpretation of a given weight value depends on where the weight is
located in the hierarchy.

This patch reimplements cfqg charge scaling so that it can be used to
support hierarchy properly.  The scheme is fairly simple and
light-weight.

* When a cfqg is added to the service tree, v(disktime)weight is
  calculated.  It walks up the tree to root calculating the fraction
  it has in the hierarchy.  At each level, the fraction can be
  calculated as

    cfqg->weight / parent->level_weight

  By compounding these, the global fraction of vdisktime the cfqg has
  claim to - vfraction - can be determined.

* When the cfqg needs to be charged, the charge is scaled inversely
  proportionally to the vfraction.

The new scaling scheme uses the same CFQ_SERVICE_SHIFT for fixed point
representation as before; however, the smallest scaling factor is now
1 (ie. 1 << CFQ_SERVICE_SHIFT).  This is different from before where 1
was for CFQ_WEIGHT_DEFAULT and higher weight would result in smaller
scaling factor.

While this shifts the global scale of vdisktime a bit, it doesn't
change the relative relationships among cfqgs and the scheduling
result isn't different.

cfq_group_notify_queue_add uses fixed CFQ_IDLE_DELAY when appending
new cfqg to the service tree.  The specific value of CFQ_IDLE_DELAY
didn't have any relevance to vdisktime before and is unlikely to cause
any visible behavior difference now especially as the scale shift
isn't that large.

As the new scheme now makes proper distinction between cfqg->weight
and ->leaf_weight, reverse the weight aliasing for root cfqgs.  For
root, both weights are now mapped to ->leaf_weight instead of the
other way around.

Because we're still using cfqg_flat_parent(), this patch shouldn't
change the scheduling behavior in any noticeable way.

v2: Beefed up comments on vfraction as requested by Vivek.
