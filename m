I think that having retry logic at the file system layer is really putting the 
fix in the wrong place.

Specifically, if we have multipath configured under a file system, it is up to 
the multipath logic to handle the failure (and use another path, retry, etc).  
If we see a failed IO further up the stack, it is *really* dead at that point.

Transient errors on normal drives are also rarely worth re-trying since pretty 
much all modern storage devices have firmware that will have done exhaustive 
retries on a failed write. Definitely not worth retrying forever for a normal 
device.

At one end of the spectrum, think of a box with dozens of storage devices 
attached (either via SAN or local S-ATA devices). If we are doing large, 
streaming writes, we could get a large amount of memory dirtied while writing. 
If that one device dies and we keep that memory in use for the endless retry 
loop, we have really cripple the box which still has multiple happy storage 
devices and file systems....
