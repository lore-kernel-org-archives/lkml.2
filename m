The problem is a little more fundamental than that. The attr cache
handling logic is some of the trickiest code to deal with in the NFS
client.

In any situation where we get back attributes, we have to decide
whether they are valid or stale. It's always possible for replies or
their handling to be reordered such that an older set of attributes
is processed after a newer set.

Unfortunately, the v2/v3 protocols do not have great support for
helping the client detect this situation, so we do the best we can with
what we do have. Unfortunately when things are changing very quickly we
can still get it wrong, especially with v2/3. [1]

In any case, the logic to determine this is in
nfs_inode_attrs_need_update(). Looking at the size is sort of the "last
resort" after we look at the timestamps and gencount.

The problem with doing what you suggest is that if we get it wrong, the
consequences are worse than the file appearing to be bigger than it is.
It means that written data may be silently lost.

======

[1]: v4 has a change attribute so it's slightly simpler there when the
server supports it. Unrelated Q for Trond: should we be checking the v4
change_attr in nfs_inode_attrs_need_update too?
