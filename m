  OK, I see. I just checked ext4 to make sure and ext4 seems to get this
right. Looking into Christoph's original patch it shouldn't be hard to fix
it. Instead of:
        atomic_inc(&mp->m_active_trans);
 
        if (wait_for_freeze)
              xfs_wait_for_freeze(mp, SB_FREEZE_TRANS);

we just need to do a bit more elaborate

retry:
        if (wait_for_freeze)
              xfs_wait_for_freeze(mp, SB_FREEZE_TRANS);
        atomic_inc(&mp->m_active_trans);
	if (wait_for_freeze && mp->m_super->s_frozen >= SB_FREEZE_TRANS) {
        	atomic_dec(&mp->m_active_trans);
		goto retry;
	}

Or does XFS support nested transactions (i.e. a thread already holding a
running transaction can call into xfs_trans_alloc() again)?
That would make things more complicated...

Using sb_start_write() instead of m_active_trans won't be that easy because
it can create A-A deadlocks (e.g. we do sb_start_write in
block_page_mkwrite() and then xfs_get_blocks() decides to start a
transaction and calls sb_start_write() again which might block if
filesystem freezing started in the mean time).

So it's up to XFS maintainers to decide what's best but I'd take
Christoph's patch with above fixup. I guess I'll put it in this series and
see what people say.
