I'm fine with requiring embedded to turn this off
where appropriate.

It seems that keeping cifs KERN_DEBUG output for
normal kernels is pretty cost free.  120KB ain't much
these days.

I do think that Al Viro & Ted Ts'o should be pinged
about their vfs tracing thoughts. (cc'd)

MIT seems to bounce my emails, so maybe you could ask
Ted directly.
