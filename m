Thanks for the pointers.  Yeah, it would be pretty interesting to have
ATA support there too and for ATA I don't really see why anyone would
mix the initiator and target driver implementations.  They may share
protocol constants and some utility functions but that will be about
it, so it will mostly be a completely separate subsystem and I think
it probably is better to put it somewhere separate too.  I think it
would be best if we can keep the two subsystems clearly separated.
They're targeting very different and most likely disjoint audiences
after all.

Thanks.
