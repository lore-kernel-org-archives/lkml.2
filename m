I will do this as the next step. The series actually contain them as
separate patches.

This is what is done currently. I have only hooked up ext4 though.
What I have done is add a new inode operation get_richacl, that 
returns struct richacl *. Are you suggesting to get rid of that
and make sure get_acl can return different type of ACL based on
argument passed ?. IMHO that would end up making the code more complex.

Can you explain this more ? What you would like to see changed ?

Thanks for the feedback.
