I will take a look at the traces.

By the sound of things, if I were you I'd turn on the mem and slab
debugging to catch use-before-init and use-after-free. Mysterious hangs
in the IO sub system are usually caused by such bugs. And the regular
debugging aids, just to see if that produces anything of interest.
