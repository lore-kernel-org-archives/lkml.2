The patch there seems much more reasonable than introducing a whole
new systemcall just for 20 lines of kernel code. New system calls are
added too easily nowadays.

As an alternative to the ioctl, I propose extending sync_file_range()
instead. E.g. add a SYNC_FILE_MOUNT flag and use that, either on any
fd on the mount or the root dir fd. That syscall is non-standard and
close enough that it can implement this behaviour too.

Greetings,

Indan
