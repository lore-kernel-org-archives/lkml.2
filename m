That sounds like a very batch design decision. Either the limits are
explicitly given and different, or if not we have to assume that they
are the same as the data limits at least.

So do they have limits or not? Essentially indefinite, what does that
mean? If they are limited, then we must have settings to cope and map
around those. If these limits are not the same as the regular data
limits, then those limits could be separate.

Yes me too, what bug triggered this patch?
