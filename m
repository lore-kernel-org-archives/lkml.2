Hi James,

Just a heads up that this patch was sent out to the list here:

[PATCH] iscsi-target: Fix SessionType=Discovery RX context conn->conn_logout_comp hang
http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=130637348407180&w=2

This now puts the PATCH-v5 series in sync wrt to bugfixes for LIO
upstream iscsi-target v4.1 code..

There have been no further review comments for an initial merge, and we
are ready to move forward.  :)

So at this point I think providing the three 'mass-market' software
fabric drivers (tcm_loop, tcm_fc and iscsi-target) makes the most sense
for mainline .40 / 2.8.0 moving forward, and focus on outstanding HW
target driver items for the next merge window.

I know things are still very busy on your side with /drivers/scsi/ code,
but wanted to ensure that iscsi-target is still included for this short
merge window considering the extensive amount of linux-scsi review, code
conversion + cleanups, and testing it has undergone in the last 6 months
since the mainline drivers/target/ merge.

Please let me know if you need anything else to get this merged
scsi-misc, or if it makes more sense given the time pressures to ask
Linus (CC'ed) to merge this directly with appropriate Signed-off-bys
from Christoph, Mike, Tomo-san, Dr. Hannes, Boaz and yourself..

I am happy either way, but just want to avoid having this slip (again)
given the large amount of efforts involved and mass market applicability
of this particular target fabric code.
