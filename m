Well your UNRESVSP can do the same thing as a ftruncate so I figured it was ok
to just go ahead and use it rather than add complexity, especially since I don't
understand this crazy fs of yours ;).

Oh I see you mean don't allow hole punch to change the size at all.  I was
thinking of doing this originally, but like I said above I figured that there
was no harm in doing the equivalent of an ftruncate.  But you are right, theres
no sense in duplicating functionality, I'll change it to keep PUNCH_HOLE from
changin the size.  Now I just need to figure out where that man page is...
