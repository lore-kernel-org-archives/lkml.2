[I'll just ignore implementation for now.., because the patch is totally
ignoring cache management.]

I have no objections to such those operations (likewise make hole,
truncate any range, etc. etc.). However, only if someone have enough
motivation to implement/maintain those operations, AND there are real
users (i.e. real sane usecase).

Otherwise, IMO it would be bad than nothing. Because, of course, if
there are such codes, we can't ignore those anymore until remove
codes completely for e.g. security reasons. And IMHO, those cache
managements to such operations are not so easy.

Thanks.
