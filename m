Yeah I intentionally left out preallocated stuff because these are going 
to be implementation specific, so I was going to leave that for a later 
exercise when people actually start doing proper implementations.

I only want it to see if SEEK_HOLE fails so I can say it didn't run.  I 
followed the same example as the fiemap test that Eric wrote.

Right, the problem with this test is it will run differently depending 
on the implementation.  I agree, I really like the noisy output tests, 
but unfortunately if I run this test on ext4 where it currently treats 
the entire file as data, and then run it on btrfs where it is smarter 
and actually recognizes holes, we end up with two different outputs that 
are both correct.

Yeah you are right, but again doing preallocated stuff is tricky, but I 
can expand it now if that's what we want.  Thanks,
