I don't know, you tell me.
Are there many users out there using 64bit feature, without the proper
user space tools?

Argh! I wish I hadn't missed the Monday call (it's
not in a good time for me).
This whole 'format change' has gone out of control
and I find it hard to present my case properly on scattered emails.

The message I am trying to get through is:
There is 32bit snapshot file format, which is implemented and well tested.
There is 64bit snapshot file format, which is not implemented yet, so
64bit and snapshot feature are mutually exclusive.
If and when 64bit snapshot file format will be implemented, it will be
a new type of extent mapped file (v2) with 48bit logical addresses.
Is this a 'format change'? Call it what you will, but it shouldn't
affect anything on existing structures. It should only affect the
non-existing structure of 64bit snapshot file.

Does this answer your question?

Amir.
