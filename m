Good interfaces are safe against stupidity, and that very much applies
to the kernel too.  Review is not an excuse for bad interfaces.

AFAICS that doesn't ensure progress, only change.  It helps those cases
which persistently return ESTALE, but not cases where there is change
but no progress.  E.g. it doesn't prevent DoS by a client doing renames
over a directory in a tight loop.
