->lookup() should (and does AFAICS) leave a fully initialized inode with
up-to-date atributes in there and at that moment there's not a lot of
sense in fetching the attributes from the server *again*.

How that lookup is implemented is another question, I can see in
nfs3_proc_lookup() that it may or may not be atomic, and retrying (and
looping) there might make sense.  But it doesn't retry and doesn't loop,
so the fact is, it will either return ESTALE (and the path lookup will
retry once with LOOKUP_REVAL) or the inode *will* be up-to-date.

So I think I'm still right that it's pointless to do retry after a
non-cached lookup.

It's just an interface question: where you put the retry logic for those
non-atomic protocols.  I think it's cleaner if the retry logic is in the
filesystem and not in the VFS.  Then NFS can do whatever it wants
without having to impose policy in the generic filesystem layer.
