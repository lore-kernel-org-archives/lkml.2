No for me. A hole is made up of zero data? It's a strange definition
for me. A hole is simply no data. With this definition a hole can be
start from a block with data but partially filled, and fs should check
instead of presence of a block, the data content. I don't like it very
much. For the fallocate case, we need only a simple rule: no check is
done beyond eof. At this point it's clear that we can check the file
block allocation till i_size, don't care if there are other blocks
allocated. I don't know if it's applicable even for unwritten extents
case.
