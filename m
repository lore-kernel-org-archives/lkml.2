Yeah sure,

I'll have to set up another testing system (on a separate partition /
volume group) for its own so that will take some time,
first tests will be run probably in the weekend,

thanks for those pointers !

I took a look at git-web - you think
5a87b7a5da250c9be6d757758425dfeaf8ed3179 might be relevant, too ?

the others seem rather minor compared to those you posted

Afaik last time I run vanilla 2.6.37-rc* (which was probably around
rc1) I saw no corruption at all but I'll give it a test-run without
the dm-crypt patch anyway

Thanks & Regards

Matt
