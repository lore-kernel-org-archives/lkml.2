That looks like the best candidate:  perhaps pa->pa_obj_lock was
one of the per-cpu lg_prealloc_lock's at that point in time.
In which case an item could be deleted from the pa list
concurrently with the function that actually crashed?

That's as far as I can get with it in the time available.
You folks do know this code much better, so perhaps just expend
a few little grey cells on that theory before calling it quits?

Cheers!
