So it might be the culprit. As the reason of the corruption is not yet 
understood, it might be that suspend/resume cycle is not necessary 
pre-requisite for this to trigger, it might just make it more likely.

And the corruption is observed to be indeed several writes of 0x00000000, 
so it could easily lead to null pointer dereferences all over the place.

Are you able to reproduce the problem if you turn kernel modesetting off?
