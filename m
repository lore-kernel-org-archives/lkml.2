Perhaps, but I don't agree that overly complicating one simple driver
to handle a wildly different set of semantics is justified when it can
be implemented in another simple driver.

Do you mean netconsole here?

It'd be great to figure out how to make this sort of data structured
in the logs, but it's not really a battle that I'm willing to fight.
It seems that as a community, we haven't figured out a good way to
provide any sort of committed ABI via printk (perhaps rightly so).

Another aspect that makes me _not_ want to go this route is the
pushback we've received in the past about not having too much data get
added to the oops messages themselves, as folks still relied on
literal screenshots of oopses.

Well, there is always panic_on_oops, which we use, but that alone
doesn't solve the recursive oops problem.

I think you are heavily discounting the value of structured data :(
It also doesn't help that printk's aren't transactional to each other
when oopsing (which essentially makes concurrently oopsing CPUs shit
all over each other in the logs, leading to unparseable data).  You
are welcome to push the rock up hill for structured log data though ;)

FWIW, another semantic difference between netconsole and netoops (that
I had missed in the last email) is filtering: we really do want to get
the whole log when a crash happens, debug messages and all.
Netconsole is subject to console filtering (which we _do_ want as
debug messages going out the uart slows the whole world down).

netconsole and netoops _do_ have bits in common, for instance the
handling of NETDEV events and source+target configuration.  I'd rather
those bits become common between the two than figure out how to jam
the semantics we need into netconsole.
