U60, with lenny (and mainline kernel) on it.  Probably ought to upgrade
to squeeze one of those days...  It works, all right, but it's only 2-way,
so reproducing would probably be harder.  Plus the fun of building the tests
themselves on somewhat different userland...

Anyway, I wonder why you care about __d_lookup_rcu() and ->d_inode stability;
d_mountpoint() _is_ stable at that point (we hold vfsmount_lock) and you
don't seem to look at ->d_inode at all in RCU case.  Note that ->d_automount()
is never called in RCU case at all; nor is ->lookup() and friends, so you
really only have ->d_manage() to cope with, what with autofs4 having no
->d_revalidate() anymore.

BTW, Nick has moved to kernel.dk; whether he's still reachable there is
a question, though - he seems to have disappeared since mid-January.
