But the point I made very early this morning still stands:  What if someone
simply wants to test the pointer, not actually to dereference it?

NFS was using rcu_dereference() for this in a couple of places - which is
overkill.  I suggested stripping this off and you countered with the
suggestion that it should be using rcu_dereference_check().

Why do I need anything at all?
