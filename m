I have some benchmarking data for various crc algorithms here:
https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Metadata_Checksums#Benchmarking

The "faster sw implementation" that I was talking about is the slice-by-8
algorithm that I sent to the crypto list a few days ago that's based off of Bob
Pearson's slice-by-8 crc32 patch.

In the huge table, "crc32c-by8-le" is crc32c slice-by-8.

Yes, the only downside to the slice-by-8 method is that it eats 8K of data
cache for the table.  Not a huge issue on recent Intel and POWER where the L1D
is 32K, but I imagine it could be painful elsewhere.

Do you know of any faster crc16 algorithms?  I guess it wouldn't be hard to
make a family of crcs, each with different cache/speed characteristics.
