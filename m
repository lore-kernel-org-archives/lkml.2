No.

For one, XFS does not require i_mutex to be held for any extent
manipulation of any kind (allocation, truncation, hole punch,
unwritten extent conversion, etc).

Hence the current structure of having the filesystem take i_mutex if
it needs it to protect allocations against races is appropriate.
