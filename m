I don't really understand why Unix domain sockets is different than any
other pathname users in this sense.  (Actually, I have never understood
why open() on a Unix domain socket doesn't give the equivalent of a
socket() + connect() -- it would make logical sense and would provide
additional functionality).

It would be different if the Unix domain sockets simply required an
absolute pathname (it is not just about the root, it is also about the
cwd, which is where the -at() functions come into play), but that is not
the case.

The abstract namespace is irrelevant for this, obviously.

Why is that?  A file descriptor carries all that information with it...
