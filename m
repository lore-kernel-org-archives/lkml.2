Yes, sorry, I should have read the patch and its description more carefully.

Simply budget and safety. I had to do that in the past, /home was 
mirrored via drbd, but /scratch was not. And although /scratch was on an 
external raid system, I simply did not setup a connection to the 
failover system. HA software is not reliable and extensive testing 
revealed possible split brain situations with corrupting double mounts. 
Nowadays there are ext4 + enabled MMP, but in 2004 there was no such 
additional protection.

That was not a compute cluster, but the diskless desktop environment. 
And things get difficult if desktop evironments start to hang. I'm not 
sure if a soft mount is the solution then, as users do not like to kill 
their running desktops. And with kde and gnome and their habit to 
monitor everything it might not be easy to kill their proccesses 
monitoring /scratch without killing the entire desktop.
But then I'm not sure if anyone still is doing async HA clusters and how 
applications react to that nowadays. I just wonder if it is always a 
good idea to loop forever in ESTALE in such situations.
