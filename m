I agree that fixing would be good. Frankly speaking I don't even have
full understanding of the problem. I know little bit from request queue
side but have no idea about referencing mechanism at device level and
how that is supposed to work with request queue referencing.

So once we understand the problem well, probably we will have an answer
how to go about fixing it.
