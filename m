Hmm.  Any interest in pushing the page copy patch as an interim solution while
I work on getting the wait-on-writeback strategy to function?  I agree it's not
the fastest solution, but at least it won't be running broken while I find the
faster solution(s).

(More on that writeback patch in a short while.)
