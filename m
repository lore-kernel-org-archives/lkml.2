Will do asap.

Yeah, strange. I looked at the code a bit and I don't see anything
obvious, ext3 seems to be using the same standard buffer head access
methods for the htree as for the rest of the metadata, and I see no
fancy playing with virtual addresses that could explain a VIVT problem.

I could be an issue with the SATA controller that gets more easily
triggered by the access patterns caused by htree, though that's a bit
strange.

I'll let you know when I have something to look at.

Cheers,
Ben.
