Tejun,

will buy us nothing in the performance level.

I am more than happy to respin it with an added interface for masking
cgroups, if you believe this is a requirement.

But hinting me about what you would like to see on that front would be
really helpful.

Re-asking my question:

cpufreq, clocksources, ftrace, etc, they all use an interface that at
this point can be considered quite standard.

Applying the same logic, each cgroup would have a pair of files:

available_controllers, current_controllers, that you can just control by
writing to.

This can get slightly funny when we consider the right semantics for the
hierarchy, but really, everything will. And it is not like we'll have
anything crazy, we just need to tailor it with care.

If you think there is any chance of this getting us somewhere, I'll code
it. But that would be something to be sent *together* with what I've
just done. As I've said, if we can't guarantee the comounting, we would
still lose all the optimization opportunities.
