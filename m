Tejun's patches don't allow concurrent cache flushes to happen, while
my patch did.  Tejun said there are drivers that can't handly empty
flushes with a bio attached, making this nessecary.   

Tejun, any idea what drivers that would be?

My kernel source doesn't have a BUG_ON line there, but only one two
lines above.  A req->nr_phys_segments that's zero sounds a bit like
empty flush requests, I'll need to look into it again.
