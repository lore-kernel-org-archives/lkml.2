Hi,
yes, the flushes are independent.

I tried some ways to improve flush merge logic. The problem I observed is something like:
say we have 10 flushes, originally we dispatch 4 flush, write, 6 flush. doing more merge
we have 6 flush, write, 4 flush. the flush request number sent to drive isn't reduced.
Another reason I didn't see improvement with better back-to-back merge might be drive
already optimizes two adjacent flushes case well.

Thanks,
