Hm... in mpage_da_submit_io I see the following sequence of calls:

1. clear_page_dirty_for_io
2. possibly one of: ext4_bio_write_page or block_write_full_page.
   If ext4_bio_write_page, 
   2a. kmem_cache_alloc
   2b. set_page_writeback

Before and after #1, the page is locked but writeback is not set.

Before #2, the page must be locked and writeback must not be set, because both
of those two functions want to set the writeback bit themselves.  However,
ext4_bio_write_page tries to allocate memory with GFP_NOFS, which means it can
sleep (I think).

Unfortunately, ext4_page_mkwrite will check for page locked, wait for page
writeback, and then return the page.  I think it is theoretically possible for
#1 to trigger a page_mkwrite which completes before #2b, right?  In which case
the thread that called mkwrite will think that the page isn't being written
out, and happily scribble on it during writeback.  I could be wrong, but it
seems to me that one has to write-protect the page after setting the writeback
bit.

I guess we could call page_mkclean from bio_integrity_prep, though.
