So, as Oren is saying, the point was to make the syscall_get_nr(..)
work according to the interface specified in
include/asm-generic/syscall.h.

Considering it's unknown how we will deal with checkpoint/restart
across CONFIG_ARM_THUMB, CONFIG_OABI_COMPAT etc., I also think it's a
better idea to checkpoint the syscall number at checkpoint and for the
restore, place architecture specific hooks to get the syscall number
instead of calling syscall_get_nr(...) directly. In this way we should
always be able to get the syscall and correctly restart, independently
of what tricks we do to checkpoint restart across configuration
settings - if any.

Best,
Christoffer
