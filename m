yes, it will be put back to the list tail. Note we always handle the
head sdev first. move the cursor of list iterating to next dev and next,
we will hit head_sdev == sdev eventually, then the loop exit. or the
cursor isn't moving, which means we have scsi_host_is_busy(). in both
cases, the loop will exit.

The main reason is we have multiple CPU trying to get the list to its
local list and then handle it, then putback unprocessed entries back. we
have multiple cpu handles blk softirq, because request rq_affinity is on
default. And the putback always happen, because scsi_run_queue is called
after every request finish. When it's called, scsi_host has just one
free slot. The in-coordination of multiple threads handle of the starved
list will mess the list. I observed dev which doesn't get chance to
dispatch request is put to starved list tail, while dev which dispatches
request is still at head. eg, this will cause unfairness. This means
some devices will get starved.
