Hmm, frankly, I decided that you agreed with my arguments..

As I wrote, I'm willing to make any changes you requests. I only asked
why this should be done.

I really don't understand why we and other similar in-kernel developers
should treat kobjects in the different way than any other subobjects of
our outer objects and make for them _additional code_ to specially treat
them as life-time center (http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/11/10/421)? You have
not explained it anywhere in any doc I can find.

This is just small "why" question. Greg, don't we have a right to ask
this before go on?

We appreciated it very much.

It is REALLY frustrating you are refusing to explain why. I guess, I'm
too stupid to figure out that alone. Don't you want we rise as highly
skilled kernel developers? I believe, not only SCST developers are very
interested to know background behind particular moves in the kernel.

Thanks,
