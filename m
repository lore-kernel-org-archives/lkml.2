Subject: [RFC PATCH] mutex: Apply adaptive spinning on mutex_trylock()

Hello, guys.

I've been playing with locking in btrfs which has developed custom
locking to avoid excessive context switches in its btree
implementation.

Generally, doing away with the custom implementation and just using
the mutex adaptive owner spinning seems better; however, there's an
interesting distinction in the custom implemention of trylock.  It
distinguishes between simple trylock and tryspin, where the former
just tries once and then fail while the latter does some spinning
before giving up.

Currently, mutex_trylock() doesn't use adaptive spinning.  It tries
just once.  I got curious whether using adaptive spinning on
mutex_trylock() would be beneficial and it seems so, at least for
btrfs anyway.

The following results are from "dbench 50" run on an opteron two
socket eight core machine with 4GiB of memory and an OCZ vertex SSD.
During the run, disk stays mostly idle and all CPUs are fully occupied
and the difference in locking performance becomes quite visible.

IMPLE is with the locking simplification patch[1] applied.  i.e. it
basically just uses mutex.  SPIN is with the patch at the end of this
message applied on top - mutex_trylock() uses adaptive spinning.

        USER   SYSTEM   SIRQ    CXTSW  THROUGHPUT
 SIMPLE 61107  354977    217  8099529  845.100 MB/sec
 SPIN   63140  364888    214  6840527  879.077 MB/sec

I've been running various different configs from yesterday and the
adaptive spinning trylock consistently posts higher throughput.  The
amount of difference varies but it outperforms consistently.

In general, I think using adaptive spinning on trylock makes sense as
trylock failure usually leads to costly unlock-relock sequence.

Also, contrary to the comment, the adaptive spinning doesn't seem to
check whether there are pending waiters or not.  Is this intended or
the test got lost somehow?

Thanks.
