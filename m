Subject: [PATCH] sd: Don't incorrectly "promote" DIF type0 into DIF type1
 disks.

If I run the following command:
# modprobe scsi_debug dev_size_mb=64 ato=1 dix=1 dif=0

then I see the following in the dmesg log:

[   25.859145] scsi_debug: host protection DIX0

Ok, DIX0, which means "no integrity extensions at all", and no DIF support at all.
I'm not sure why you'd advertise DIX0 at all, but so far so good.

(DIX is the mechanism by which the OS sends integrity data to the disk in
whatever format DIF specifies.  You need DIF for DIX to do anything.)

Huh??  Here we are turning on DIX support as if the disk supports DIF type1.
This seems strange to me because we didn't advertise any DIF support at all.

[   25.952208] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI disk

[   25.980262] IP: [<ffffffffa01ebaa5>] resp_read.part.38+0x145/0x420 [scsi_debug]

Uhoh, that shouldn't happen.  The SCSI layer sent along what looks like a type1
read request even though the disk wasn't really prepared to handle it, and
kaboom.  I don't think this particular combination is terribly common, but we
could at least not misprogram the disk when we see it.

If the disk advertises DIF type 0, we can skip the rest of the DIF setup.
Right now, the SCSI layer "promotes" a DIF type 0 disk into a DIF type 1 disk,
which seems incorrect.
