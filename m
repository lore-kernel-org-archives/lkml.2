Could you please explain exactly how? Simply replace sd{X} by the 
preferred name in /dev/kmsg? How do make make sure you do not replace 
something that is not supposed to be replaced? I think unless you plan 
to modify existing kernel device message you cannot, as sd{X} is too 
general.
And how does /dev/kmsg solve the serial console problem?

However, I think a real technical issue with any udev device name rules 
remains - it often does not work well with multipath devices. Alua 
partly solves that problem, but only if there is a direct connection to 
each of the alua controllers. But if there is a switch in between, there 
are often several devices with the same alua score. And the situation is 
even worse with multipath hardware that does not know alua at all.
So for many multipath devices it probably would not make sense to set 
alias names. But especially on those system you often would like to have 
suitable alias names, as it gets a bit chaotic without (I had to deal 
with 30 or even 60 devices x 8 paths in the past...).

Cheers,
Bernd
