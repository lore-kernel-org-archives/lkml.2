That was a rhetorical questions. I meant  ext* is not special. There
are plenty of other FFs that are common to unix systems.

No! on all modern Linux distro's ntfs (ntfs-3g) is supported with
that infamous FUSE driver. The Kernel driver is long dead. The same
FUSE driver is also used under *BSD and officially supported by
Apple in OSX. Last benchmarks I saw where Faster then ext2 and in-par
with ext3, MetaData faster, IO slower then ext3. Stability is very
good and I never had an issue, on any of the above systems.

There is also a very good fsck and a suit of other tools under the same
ntfs-3g project. To date I have fixed 10s of friends/family Windows
machines with a Linux rescue USB-stick, I mean machines that would even
boot.

Again, for the last time, you are the maintainer, you do what you
understand, I hope Linus or someone can make it more clear than me.

There is nothing special about USB sticks and ext* filesystems it
is the same old "shared files" problem. If you are not under a single
NIS domain, then these are different users. If files need to be shared
they need to sit in the proper CHMODed directory and bits.

I have at home a bittorent network directory for the all family, So the
first time I set it up I had to ssh into the server and fix the permissions.
That was easy enough listen to learn.

For the last time and I'm off this for good:
	"Shared files" problem is not solved by mount options.

Been there done that
