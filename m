It is easy enough to make a single path use mpath.  Just verify/modify
/etc/multipath.conf so that your device isn't blacklisted.

multipathd will even work with a scsi-debug device.

You obviously won't get path failover but you'll see the path get marked
faulty, etc.

Yes, we discussed this issue of needing to train dm-multipath to know if
there was a transport failure or not (at LSF).  But I'm not sure when
Hannes intends to repost his work in this area (updated to account for
feedback from LSF).

I think we'd prefer to have a device fail rather than jeopardize data
integrity.  Clearly not ideal but...
