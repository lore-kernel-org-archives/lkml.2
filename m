This series fixes a couple of bugs related to discovering changes to
devices.  1) We should not consider a firmware change to mean the
device identity has changed.  Just because a logical drive's firmware
changes doesn't mean it's not the same drive with the same data, so
it should not be removed and re-added to the scsi mid layer.
2) Likewise if the RAID level is observed to change.  This can happen
for instance by doing a RAID level migration from with the Array
Configuration Utility.

      hpsa: do not consider firmware revision when looking for device changes.
      hpsa: do not consider RAID level to be part of device identity
