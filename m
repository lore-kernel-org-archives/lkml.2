pid in the netlink context is the netlink port-id.  It is a very
different concept from struct pid.  These days netlink calls to
the kernel are synchronous, not that I would encourage netlink
for anything except networking code.

Can we make this a trivial filesystem?  I expect that would match
up better with whatever plan9 userspace apps already exist,
remove the inode double translation, and would make it much more
reasonable to do a user namespace aware version  if and when
that becomes necessary.
