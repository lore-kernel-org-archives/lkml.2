commit 53d4737580535e073963b91ce87d4216e434fab5
Author: Chuck Lever <chuck.lever@oracle.com>
Date:   Fri Mar 11 15:31:06 2011 -0500

    NFS: NFSROOT should default to "proto=udp"
    
    There have been a number of recent reports that NFSROOT is no longer
    working with default mount options, but fails only with certain NICs.
    
    Brian Downing <bdowning@lavos.net> bisected to commit 56463e50 "NFS:
    Use super.c for NFSROOT mount option parsing".  Among other things,
    this commit changes the default mount options for NFSROOT to use TCP
    instead of UDP as the underlying transport.
    
    TCP seems less able to deal with NICs that are slow to initialize.
    The system logs that have accompanied reports of problems all show
    that NFSROOT attempts to establish a TCP connection before the NIC is
    fully initialized, and thus the TCP connection attempt fails.
    
    When a TCP connection attempt fails during a mount operation, the
    NFS stack needs to fail the operation.  Usually user space knows how
    and when to retry it.  The network layer does not report a distinct
    error code for this particular failure mode.  Thus, there isn't a
    clean way for the RPC client to see that it needs to retry in this
    case, but not in others.
    
    Because NFSROOT is used in some environments where it is not possible
    to update the kernel command line to specify "udp", the proper thing
    to do is change NFSROOT to use UDP by default, as it did before commit
    56463e50.
    
    To make it easier to see how to change default mount options for
    NFSROOT and to distinguish default settings from mandatory settings,
    I've adjusted a couple of areas to document the specifics.
    
    root_nfs_cat() is also modified to deal with commas properly when
    concatenating strings containing mount option lists.  This keeps
    root_nfs_cat() call sites simpler, now that we may be concatenating
    multiple mount option strings.

    nfs: close NFSv4 COMMIT vs. CLOSE race
    
    I've been adding in more artificial delays in the NFSv4 commit and close
    codepaths to uncover races. The kernel I'm testing has the patch to
    close the race in __rpc_wait_for_completion_task that's in Trond's
    cthon2011 branch. The reproducer I've been using does this in a loop:
    
    	mkdir("DIR");
    	fd = open("DIR/FILE", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0644);
    	write(fd, "abcdefg", 7);
    	close(fd);
    	unlink("DIR/FILE");
    	rmdir("DIR");
    
    The above reproducer shouldn't result in any silly-renaming. However,
    when I add a "msleep(100)" just after the nfs_commit_clear_lock call in
    nfs_commit_release, I can almost always force one to occur. If I can
    force it to occur with that, then it can happen without that delay
    given the right timing.
    
    nfs_commit_inode waits for the NFS_INO_COMMIT bit to clear when called
    with FLUSH_SYNC set. nfs_commit_rpcsetup on the other hand does not wait
    for the task to complete before putting its reference to it, so the last
    reference get put in rpc_release task and gets queued to a workqueue.
    
    In this situation, the last open context reference may be put by the
    COMMIT release instead of the close() syscall. The close() syscall
    returns too quickly and the unlink runs while the d_count is still
    high since the COMMIT release hasn't put its dentry reference yet.
    
    Fix this by having rpc_commit_rpcsetup wait for the RPC call to complete
    before putting the task reference when FLUSH_SYNC is set. With this, the
    last reference is put by the process that's initiating the FLUSH_SYNC
    commit and the race is closed.

commit bf294b41cefcb22fc3139e0f42c5b3f06728bd5e
Author: Trond Myklebust <Trond.Myklebust@netapp.com>

    SUNRPC: Close a race in __rpc_wait_for_completion_task()
    
    Although they run as rpciod background tasks, under normal operation
    (i.e. no SIGKILL), functions like nfs_sillyrename(), nfs4_proc_unlck()
    and nfs4_do_close() want to be fully synchronous. This means that when we
    exit, we want all references to the rpc_task to be gone, and we want
    any dentry references etc. held by that task to be released.
    
    For this reason these functions call __rpc_wait_for_completion_task(),
    followed by rpc_put_task() in the expectation that the latter will be
    releasing the last reference to the rpc_task, and thus ensuring that the
    callback_ops->rpc_release() has been called synchronously.
    
    This patch fixes a race which exists due to the fact that
    rpciod calls rpc_complete_task() (in order to wake up the callers of
    __rpc_wait_for_completion_task()) and then subsequently calls
    rpc_put_task() without ensuring that these two steps are done atomically.
    
    In order to avoid adding new spin locks, the patch uses the existing
    waitqueue spin lock to order the rpc_task reference count releases between
    the waiting process and rpciod.
    The common case where nobody is waiting for completion is optimised for by
    checking if the RPC_TASK_ASYNC flag is cleared and/or if the rpc_task
    reference count is 1: in those cases we drop trying to grab the spin lock,
    and immediately free up the rpc_task.
    
    Those few processes that need to put the rpc_task from inside an
    asynchronous context and that do not care about ordering are given a new
    helper: rpc_put_task_async().
