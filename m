While it's your opinion that userland alternatives "already work",
in reality they are unsuitable for several real use-cases. The
userland approach has serious restrictions - which I will cover
in a follow-up post to my discussion with Gene soon.

Note that one important point of agreement was that DMTCP's ability
to provide "glue" to restart applications without their original
context is _orthogonal_ to how the core c/r is done. IOW - there
exciting goodies from DMTCP are useful with either form of c/r.

You also argue that "virtualization" (VMs?) covers everything else,
implying that lightweight virtualization is useless. In reality it
is an important technology, already in the kernel (surely you don't
suggest to pull it out ?!) and for a reason. That is already a very
good reason to provide, e.g. containers c/r and live-migration to
keep it competitive and useful.

Thanks,

Oren.
