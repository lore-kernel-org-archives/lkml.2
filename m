  The code has this live-lock since Nick fixed data integrity issues in
write_cache_pages which was (digging) commit 05fe478d ("mm:
write_cache_pages integrity fix") in January 2009. Jens just kept the code
as it was...

  (b) does not work for data integrity sync (see changelog of the above
mentioned commit). I was sending a patch doing (a) in February but in
particular you raised concerns whether it's not too expensive... Since
it indeed has some cost (although I was not able to measure any performance
impact) and I didn't know a better solution, I just postponed the patches.
But I guess it's time to revive the series and maybe we'll get further with
it.
