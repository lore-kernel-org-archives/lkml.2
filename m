Mike,

First off, sorry for not responding on this earlier. When I saw the
original patch, I was thinking it is a generic policy issue, and James
would be a better person to make decision on this, and forgot about it.

Now only realized that James was waiting on me.

I am not very religious either, and agree with James on changing the
Changelog.

With that change,

Acked-by: Chandra Seetharaman <sekharan@us.ibm.com>

Regards,

Chandra
