fsync(). Which may succeed if the user renews their ticket first.
However you may still have data loss if dirty data has been lost because
of EKEYEXPIRED returns on the WRITE RPC call...

Also, for the fsync() to return EKEYEXPIRED _after_ the user has renewed
their ticket would seem counter-intuitive to most people.
