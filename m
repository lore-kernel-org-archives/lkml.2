Vivek, I'm not sure this is a general solution. If we hand journal
IO off to a workqueue, then we've got no idea what the "dependent
task" is.

I bring this up as I have a current patchset that moves all the XFS
journal IO out of process context into a workqueue to solve
process-visible operation latency (e.g. 1000 mkdir syscalls run at
1ms each, the 1001st triggers a journal checkpoint and takes 500ms)
and background checkpoint submission races.  This effectively means
that XFS will trigger the same bad CFQ behaviour on fsync, but have
no means of avoiding it because we don't have a specific task to
yield to.

And FWIW, we're going to be using workqueues more and more in XFS
for asynchronous processing of operations. I'm looking to use WQs
for speculative readahead of inodes, all our delayed metadata
writeback, log IO submission, free space allocation requests,
background inode allocation, background inode freeing, background
EOF truncation, etc to process as much work asynchronously outside
syscall context as possible (let's use all those CPU cores we
have!).

All of these things will push potentially dependent IO operations
outside of the bounds of the process actually doing the operation,
so some general solution to the "dependent IO in an undefined thread
context" problem really needs to be solved sooner rather than
later...

As it is, I don't have any good ideas of how to solve this, but I
thought it is worth bringing to your attention while you are trying
to solve a similar issue.

Cheers,

Dave.
