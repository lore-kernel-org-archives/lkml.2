Ok, so you are thinking about a seperate transport_emulate_write_same()
and transport_emulate_unmap() called from
transport_emulate_control_cdb(), right..?

Yes, these are already available from the passed struct
se_task->task_lba and ->task_size values.

Yes, so the problem of trying to make this code generic (eg: outside of
TCM subsystem plugins) is that blk_issue_discard() takes struct
block_device, which means we the subsystem plugin has to locate struct
block_device inside of non generic cide.

So, then the main issue becomes FILEIO + block level discard and how to
issue an blk_issue_discard() from struct fileio in the most sane way.
If there is no sane way then I will just drop this bit, or just do the
file level 'hole punch' that you are speaking about.

Ok, I will disable these by default for IBLOCK and FILEIO, and require
an explict override from user with the emulate_tpu and emulate_tpws
values in /sys/kernel/config/target/core/$HBA/$DEV/attrib/

The igrab() and iput() usage in FILEIO code are used for locating the
struct block_device for blk_issue_discard().  If this is the case then I
will remove these from FILEIO.

Thanks!
