Ok.  I have a rough sketch of a patch to do that, and I was going to send it
out today, but the test machine caught on fire while I was hammering it with
the fsync tests one last time and ... yeah.  I'm fairly sure the patch didn't
cause the fire, but I'll check anyway after I finish cleaning up.

"[PATCH] ext4: Don't set my machine ablaze with barrier requests" :P

(The patch did seem to cut barrier requests counts by about 20% though the
impact on performance was pretty small.)
