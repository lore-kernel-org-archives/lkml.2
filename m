Depends what you're doing about the flush problem.  The synchronisation
is inherent in the use (we're holding a reference to the module within
the executed code).  The flush is to try to speed things up so the user
doesn't get annoyed during rmmod.  We don't need a sync, just an
accelerator.

Because it's completely lame to have user context and not use it.

I really don't think the open coding is a good idea.  It's complex and
error prone; exactly the type of thing that should be in an API.
