Possibly, could you put a timestamp in the passed object ? (Given the
expiry of such a uid offer is kind of policy)

That I think needs fixing anyway and now is a good time as any to do it.
If you are going to be able to pass userids then you need to be sure you
don't get passed a handle with a uid change on it that you didn't want so
adding another object type and option of some kind to accept them has to
occur anyway.

That also btw needs fixing for other reasons - more than one daemon has
been written that generically uses recvmsg and so can be attacked with FD
leaks >-)
