But it does tell us the put must be racing with dispatch, since
dereferencing the command to find the device worked higher up in
scsi_dispatch_cmd().

There is one way to invalidate the theory that we cloned something with
an attached command, and that's to put 

BUG_ON(rq->special)

in blk_insert_cloned_request().  I think we're careful about clearing
it, so it should work (perhaps a warn on just in case).
