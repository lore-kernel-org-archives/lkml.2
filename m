I looked into implementing revoke() a while ago, and looked at how BSD
did it.  They really only implemented it for a very narrow range of
devices (tty only I think), which is not what we really want.

I thought people wanted it for all char and block devices, if this isn't
so, then it might be easier to implement than I thought.

So, what do we really need revoke() for these days?

But that's getting away from the original topic here, sorry...
