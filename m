No, this is unrelated to module unloading and the problem affects
statically linked filesystems also.  The requirement is that all inodes
which are pending rcu freeing be flushed (and freed) before their cache
is destroyed in kmem_cache_destroy().

And...  it seems that I misread what's going on.  The individual
filesystems are doing the rcu freeing of their inodes, so it is
appropriate that they also call rcu_barrier() prior to running
kmem_cache_free().  Which is what Kirill's patch does.  oops.
