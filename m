Well, just what the list of possible/available hardware WWNs that the
fabric module will be referencing for the individual:

	mkdir -p /sys/kernel/config/target/$TCM_FAB_MOD/$FABRIC_WWPN

to locate and initialize the per HW port context fabric module configfs
group.

Hmmmm, well configfs is entirely driven by userspace syscalls, so we
want to try to avoid doing this (jlbec CC'ed).  We want userspace code
to parse a list of these values from sysfs+configfs and use these
individual HW WWPN value(s) as the directory/group names for the
mkdir(2) mentioned above.

Well, it really depends on what is required for individual target fabric
modules I think, and perhaps could contain some other useful information
about target mode HW specific available resources.  For the HW FC +
libfc case, as long as the LLD continues to register TARGET_MODE capable
HW ports in /sys/class, I think we should be good to go.
