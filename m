James,
This patch to the sd driver together with the one I made
to the scsi_debug driver (sent to the linux-scsi list)
fixes the corruption problem in lk 2.6.36 .

Below is a dd command and the resulting log file
ouput. The log shows the actual SCSI READs sent
to the scsi_debug pseudo device (the medium error
is at LBA 0x1234):

# dd if=/dev/sdc of=ttt.img
dd: reading `/dev/sdc': Input/output error
4656+0 records in
4656+0 records out

Almost perfect. It was reading 256 blocks at a time and
hit trouble at LBA 0x11e0 . So then it reads 4 KB (8
blocks) at a time starting at LBA 0x11e0 until it hits
the medium error again. Well it didn't need to read
the medium error again. And what was it thinking when
it read 256 blocks starting at LBA 0x12e0 (i.e. after
the medium error)? Correct but not optimal.


Moving right along, these words are written in the t13.org
document: d2015r3 otherwise know as ACS-2 for ATA
(including SATA) disks:

"If an unrecoverable error occurs while the device is
processing this command, then the device shall return
command completion with the Error bit set to one and
the LBA field set to the LBA of the logical sector where
the first unrecoverable error occurred . The validity
of the data transferred is indeterminate ."

That is for the READ DMA EXT command. When I check
drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c it doesn't touch the resid
field. That means resid is at its default value of
zero implying the data-in buffer is "all good". So
do we know what common practice is for ATA disks in
this situation?
