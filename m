Hi Greg and Ben,

Please consider

  9bc3711cbb67 [SCSI] hpsa: Fix problem with MSA2xxx devices

for application to next week's 3.0.y, 3.2.y, and 3.3.y trees.

As Steven Williamson noticed[1], without this patch:

> The hpsa driver fails to correctly assign devices when there are
> multiple paths on at least the Smart Array 712m with the latest
> firmware.
>
> The end result is only one device node is created in /dev and multipath
> tools then only detect one path.

He tested this patch + fda38518f236 "[SCSI] hpsa: add P2000 to list of
shared SAS devices" (which is already in v3.0) on top of a
2.6.32.y-based kernel and found:

> Applying the patch here:
> http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg56690.html
> to the current stable version of the squeeze kernel fixes the issue.
>
> This was tested on a Smart Array 712m, connected via 2 SAS switches to a
> HP P2000 G3 SAS Array.

Stephen, are any other patches from the series at [2] or elsewhere
candidates for inclusion in stable trees?

Thanks and hope that helps,
Jonathan
