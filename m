Yes, I have envisioned the princaple pieces of TCM/ConfigFS design being
very much SCSI fabric independent from the start of v3.0 development,
and I think the v4.0 virtual HBA/DEV abstraction now present in
target_core_configfs.c and fabric module independent control plane in
target_core_fabric_configfs.c does demonstrate this design feature.

Of course doing 'SCSI-less' target mode this would still involve some
work to target_core_transport.c to add ATA specific
emulation/passthrough and disable others for the default SPC-3 emulation
logic currently in place.  However, I do believe the TCM subsystem
plugin API in target_core_transport.h for pSCSI, iBLOCK, FILEIO, etc is
already more or less SCSI fabric independent and adding a libata
subsystem plugin (eg: with it's own set of TCM fabric modules) minus
current libata-scsi.c glue code would be possible if the libata folks
would like to entertain that discussion..

Honestly, I tend not to care very much about naming and things, but that
said I would really hate to have to rename actual TCM code at this point
for .37 (other than say directory location/layout and file names) while
the drivers/target/lio-target -> iscsi_proto.h conversion is still on
our TODO list.

Best,
