It depends what the drive is caching and what's removable.  If it's some
type of hybrid, and the cache isn't mapped to the media for instance.

The point really is that if the cache is in the housing, setting it to
write through when it's not is not a correct reflection of reality.

None I can think of.  When the caching logic was first done, I don't
think removable media were even considered, so it was all about shutdown
behaviour.

right: We don't currently track dirty state.  We could, I suppose, but I
don't think it's worth it.

Heh, if you want to open that old can of worms again, be my guest ...

or actually, just checking the value when it looks at the return code.

Heh, I've got a long inbox full of complaints about the two capacity
messages we used to print on boot ...
