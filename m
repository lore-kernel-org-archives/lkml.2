There's been a singular lack of comments on this.

To me, the code looks reasonable (at just over 200 lines for the socket
passing.  It's extensible to support arbitrary login protocols, and it
doesn't impact the fast path at all.

Now that we have the actual code, it's a lot cleaner even than I
imagined ... is there any objection simply to doing this?
