No matter how hard I try, I always read this as "DAMAGED".  Which I
can't help but imagine subliminally influences the reader's opinion of
the patches.

Of course I am excellent at naming things, see "chunkfs" and
"relatime".  But some ideas for naming various concepts in this patch:

D_MIGHT_MOUNT
D_CHILL_OUT
D_ITS_COMPLICATED

-VAL
