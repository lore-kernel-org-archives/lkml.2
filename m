???

A potential thing affects all users that *can be* affected by actual
log spoofing.  This is what the word "potential" means.

Analogy: if some privilege escalation bug is found in some very core
code then all users iteracting with an untrusted security domains
(local users, network, etc.) being able to exploit it would be affected.
It is silly to say that nobody is affected because you just don't know
any such cases of this bug exploitation in the past.

A sample:

Is BEL dangerous?  I can imagine 200 BELs/scrolls down would hang a
slow tty by a considerable amount of time without ^C ability to kill the
log viewer.  On the rest ttys it is harmless.  Even Alan wanted to add
it to the white list, not just exclude from the black list.


If someone skilled in the TTY codes provides us the full analysis of tty
code table with *a proof* what codes are harmfull (in the sense of
logging) and what are not, the question would be closed.  I'm not
skilled it in, I'd not try to do it (maybe the manpage is incomplete?).
I've reported just the *known for sure* farmfull sequence (the first
report of cntrl chars harm belogs to Solar Designer and dates to 2006:
http://lists.openwall.net/linux-kernel/2006/08/22/29).

You were talking about dangers in general, I'm answering about it in
general too.

Note it is not bad characters, but character sequences.  You cannot just
grep for bad substrings because of KERN_CONT (because the black list means
everything not denied is permitted, and breaking ctrl sequence is then
permitted, right?), so you have to define a state machine for this
filtering (if you want to filter just only bad charsequences).  It looks
too complicated for me for this little thing - just to write to a log
with user supplied data.  But you say it is simplier and safer, maybe
you will do it?

Sure, that's why maintainers exist and they should be competent to
ack/nak the solution that does/doesn't fit the actual needs.

BTW, it has happened because of missing clear conversions about what
characters printk() can be fed.  In the comment the encoding is not
mentioned, only "See also: printf(3)", which might be related to format
strings only.

Also '\n' problem with multiline messages wouldn't arrise if printk()
was clearly declared as a function logging exactly one line.

All control characters except space chars (tabs and \n) are not needed
for the log purposes, they define the cursor position, output colors,
and tty modes.  All this is not needed for log purposes, it is a cynical
log, not a cristmas tree.


> and the reason for exclusion.

Note that *you* want to define a black list with a clear denied
semantics, I want to do the reverse - to define the allowed semantics,
which additionally implies better API semantics understanding.  I don't
need to enumerate all evils, I'm evading it by defining what one can do
for sure.


I don't understand why you so resist to define API more clear to avoid
other possible problems in the future.
