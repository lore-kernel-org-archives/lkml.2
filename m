It's hardly pointless.  The kmap sets up an inequivalent alias in the
cache.  When you write to the kmap region, you dirty the CPU caches for
that alias.  If you tear down the mapping without flushing, the CPU will
write out the cache lines at its leisure.  If you access the line via
the other mapping *before* the CPU does writeout, you see stale data.

When the kernel dirties a kmap region, it always has to flush somehow
before kunmap.  One of the problems here is that that flush isn't in the
NFS code.

I didn't say it was kmap's entire problem ... I just said, can't we
simplify some of this by consolidating the flushing into the interfaces.
