I can see nd is used in nfs_open_revalidate(), but is it
necessarily used in nfs_lookup_revalidate()?  I'm way out of my
depth here, but everywhere it's used in nfs_lookup_revalidate()
(nfs_neg_need_reval(), nfs_is_exclusive_create(),
nfs_lookup_verify_inode()) there are also checks for nd != NULL.

'Cos Trond scared me into it!  ;-)

But mostly because I don't really know what I'm doing. The
original patch came about because I was tracking down the Oops
in the NFS code and it seemed such an obvious fix that
lookup_one_len() passes down a hard-coded NULL and that NULL
isn't checked in all the d_revalidate routines. I thought I'd do
the right thing and make sure it was checked everywhere. Little
did I know there's "history" behind it! I'm afraid I don't know
anywhere near enough to argue about the right way to deal with it.

See other reply: it wasn't a stacked file system.

But it seems useful to have the d_revalidate routines indicate
via the log that they're being abused.
