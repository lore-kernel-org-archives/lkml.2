Well, that's why I am concerned with merging the ext4 snapshots. This is
exactly the reason why people will get nervous when you try to push a
huge change like ext4 snapshots into the stable code base. Yes, when you
do not compile it in, it does not affect the fs very much, but try to
tell people that ext4 is not the old-good-stable-ext4 when you enable
this feature. And I do not believe that snapshot code does not interfere
with the old ext4 code paths, so there is a place for horrible bugs
waiting for us.

It does not matter that much how long or how much your embedded
production systems are out there. The fact is that it is really very
limited work load variation, hence very limited testing.

So it is true, when you have an fs problem (corruption) you have to
blast off all your snapshots ?

But I do understand the difference. And also, when it comes to fs level
snapshotting I would suspect that it would do something we can not do
with the current solutions, for example per-file or per-directory snapshots,
cat ext4 snapshots do that ?

But again, it was two years ago and even back then you have not had any
numbers proving your statements.

That would be great. Thanks!

But they are really not, because otherwise it would complement each
other, but they are all trying to do the same thing, except btrfs has
it for free.

Well, I would like to have your confidence. Why do you think so ? They
will use it for what ? Doing backups ? We can do this easily with LVM
without any risk of compromising existing filesystem at all. On desktop
? I very much doubt that since you can not do per directory (or per
file) snapshots, can you ?

It would be of course, except you're the only one saying that.

Thanks!
