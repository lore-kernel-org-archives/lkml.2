Wait, aren't we confusing client and server side here?

If I read Namjae Jeon's post correctly, I understood that it was the
*server* side he was modifying to start writeout sooner, to improve
response time to eventual expected commits from the client.  The
responses above all seem to be about the client.

Maybe it's all the same at some level, but: naively, starting writeout
early would seem a better bet on the server side.  By the time we get
writes, the client has already decided they're worth sending to disk.

And changes to make clients and applications friendlier to the server
are great, but we don't always have that option--there are more clients
out there than servers and the latter may be easier to upgrade than the
former.
