We have all the information ... the fs will eventually mark the page
dirty when it finishes the alterations, we just have to find a way to
express that.

If you're thinking of the double fault scenario where the page
spontaneously corrupts *and* the filesystem alters it, then the only way
of detecting that is to freeze the page as it undergoes I/O ... which
involves quite a bit of filesystem surgery, doesn't it?
