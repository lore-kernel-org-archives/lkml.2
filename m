So you want revoke() on a block device to do what?  The same thing as
disconnecting it from the hardware level?

Oh, I forgot that this came up while we were drinking at the LinuxCon
Japan conference this year and we figured out that you could just use
the 'unbind' and 'bind' files in sysfs to disconnect and reconnect the
device from the driver from userspace which would simulate a revoke()
call on pretty much any type of char device we have today.

Sure, it's crude, and yes, it's the result of a lot of whisky, but even
now, it still seems like a nice hack if you really want and need this
from userspace :)
