No, sorry, you misunderstand me. Here, I meant your complain that we are
not fast enough with pushing patches. Some of us simply do not push
patches as soon as they are written. I personally prefer deferring
patches for some time (weeks) to actually give some testing to the
changes. Simply because I have bad experiences with patches emerging in
the (-next) tree immediately. (And I mean not only my patches.)

While you are pointing to whitespace cleanup of whole subtrees. Yes, I
wrote about _whitespace_ cleanup in the thread you are referring to. But
this can be generalized to an arbitrary cleanup. I.e. changes which do
not change functionality in no way. And that is doubtful with pr_*
changes. But as you can see in my post a couple of minutes ago, maybe I
am just missing the point of the new interface. (And I hate naming of
the pr_* functions.)

And BTW setting the argument that it is a newer interface (that is what
ath5k pr_* conversion patches commit log says) is not a good
justification at all.
