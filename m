My comment has targeted the new unknown boards, to resolve this it would be easier
to have a list of resettable controllers. (complement to what it is now).

Fact is, that I forgot that a hpsa_allow_any option has to be set before you can
use an 'unknown' controller and combined with your promise

I'm fine with the original approach.
