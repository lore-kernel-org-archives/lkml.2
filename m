No. If I reviewed 40 patches perfectly, I would take long long time (the 
previous 2-line patch that I reviewed took me a week to review --- but I 
found a flaw that the other people who reviewed it quickly didn't find). 

So I reviewed only "dm" patch and found out that it is too big.

Make a smaller patch with barrier -> FLUSH logic only. And then you can 
make additional patches with function/variable renames or logic changes.

I am not dismissing anything. I agree with barrier -> flush change. It 
simplifies things a lot.

But I have my work rules that I learned: I use no git kernels and no 
external patches (except Alasdair's patchset that I want to test). I only 
use -rc or final kernels. I need a stable computer --- I don't want to 
solve problems like "does it crash because I pulled something or does it 
crash because I made a bug in my code?" So, put that into 2.6.37-rc1 and 
I'll optimize flushes in dm for -rc2 or -rc3.
