No problem. I didn't spend too much time in writing the patch. Getting
rid of get_prioidx() was simple. I just wanted to help out, but then
I might to slow to keep up with you :)

Though I have a question on the patch you are writing. When you disable
broken_hierarchy for the networking controllers, are you also 
considering to disable them on the root cgroup? Currently both
net_prio and net_cls will do work on the root cgroup. I think for
harmonizing the behavior or all controllers this should also be
disabled.

net_prio doesn't have any particular requirements on the indexing, 
unless there is one. So a global ida would work for net_prio.
