I can't shake the feeling that EPOLL_CTL_DISABLE is solving a
non-problem, or, more precisely, that there should be a perfectly good
userspace solution with no kernel changes.

Unless something is rather buggy in kernel land (and I don't think it
is), once EPOLL_CTL_DEL has returned, no call to epoll_wait that starts
*after* EPOLL_CTL_DEL finishes will return that object.  This suggests
an RCU-like approach: once EPOLL_CTL_DEL has returned and every thread
has returned from an epoll_wait call that started after the
EPOLL_CTL_DEL returns, then the data structure can be safely freed.

In pseudocode:

delete(fd, pdata) {
  pdata->dead = true;
  EPOLL_CTL_DEL(fd);
  rcu_call(delete pdata);
}

wait() {
  epoll_wait;
  for each event pdata {
    if (pdata->gone) continue;
    process the event;
  }

  rcu_this_is_a_grace_period();
}

Of course, these are not normal grace periods and would need to be
tracked separately.  (The optimal data structure to do this without
killing scalability is not obvious.  urcu presumably implements such a
thing.)

Am I right?
