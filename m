There's cap_mknod, and cgroup/devices.{allow,deny}.  Even with CAP_MKNOD,
container can not _use_ devices not allowed in the latter.  That's what
I'm talking about - there's more fine control exist than CAP_MKNOD.  And
my question was about this context - with proper cgroup-level device
control in place, what bad CAP_MKNOD have?

Thanks,
