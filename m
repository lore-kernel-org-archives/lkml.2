Uhh, lost of "free" is rather significant.

Probably it is the way to go.  Users still may identify *some*
information about the slab objects in question (ecryptfs, etc.), but it
is more limited with MB granularity.  Though, it is probably the only
acceptable tradeoff in sense of backward compatibility.
