Well the standard does say the length must be exactly 2 rather than just 
defining it a leaf node that contains an EUI-64. But I did not realise 
various firmware gets things quite so wrong sometimes...

Wow. I didn't expect things to get so bad. :-( I guess in this case we 
simply ignore the return value, which would have the effect of not 
setting the GUID.

I believe multipathing is handled by multipathd, which uses devmapper to 
handle the actual data flow. Multipathd itself works out which LUNs it 
can see over multiple paths (using multiple /dev/sdX devices) and just 
creates the devmapper mappings as necessary. I'm not even convinced 
multipathd would care about the SBP-2 target port identifier, preferring 
instead to use the WWN on the LUN.

HTH,
Chris
