Yeap.

Yeah, it can be made to work via a queue callback but I'm afraid that
would be a genuine layering violation (although going through SCSI is
extra layering, it isn't really a layering violation).

These are request_queue methods.

	request_fn_proc		*request_fn;
	make_request_fn		*make_request_fn;
	prep_rq_fn		*prep_rq_fn;
	unplug_fn		*unplug_fn;
	merge_bvec_fn		*merge_bvec_fn;
	prepare_flush_fn	*prepare_flush_fn;
	softirq_done_fn		*softirq_done_fn;
	rq_timed_out_fn		*rq_timed_out_fn;
	dma_drain_needed_fn	*dma_drain_needed;
	lld_busy_fn		*lld_busy_fn;

These are gendisk methods.

	int (*open) (struct block_device *, fmode_t);
	int (*release) (struct gendisk *, fmode_t);
	int (*locked_ioctl) (struct block_device *, fmode_t, unsigned, unsigned long);
	int (*ioctl) (struct block_device *, fmode_t, unsigned, unsigned long);
	int (*compat_ioctl) (struct block_device *, fmode_t, unsigned, unsigned long);
	int (*direct_access) (struct block_device *, sector_t,
						void **, unsigned long *);
	int (*media_changed) (struct gendisk *);
	void (*unlock_native_capacity) (struct gendisk *);
	int (*revalidate_disk) (struct gendisk *);
	int (*getgeo)(struct block_device *, struct hd_geometry *);

request_queue is (or at least supposed to be) oblivious about genhd
and its attributes including capacity.  After all, request_queue can
exist w/o genhd associated, so it would be quite odd to have capacity
related method living in request_queue.

Another thing is that there is no generic way to reach the associated
genhd from request_queue and I can't think of a clean way to map
request_queue to the associated ata device w/o in-flight requests (can
you even do that from SCSI?).

Unfortunately, libata is still properly layered below SCSI, so I'm
afraid threading through sd is clumsy yet the cleanest way to do it.

Thanks.
