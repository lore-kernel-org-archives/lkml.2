That was my original argument for my patch.  I lost it because you can
still hold a queue reference in the sysfs code for block, which means
that the put in blk_cleanup_queue() won't be the final one and you'll
get a use after free of the lock when the sysfs directory is exited
because we take the lock again as we destroy the elevator.

So this I agree with.  blk_cleanup_queue() prevents any new access to
the queue, but we still have the old reference holders to contend with.
They can submit requests, although we try to error them again with the
queue guards check.

The only code for which this could be true is code where we use the
block supplied lock, so effectively it never changes.  The drivers which
supply their own lock are supposed to have already ensured that the
queue is unused.  I don't really believe this given the sysfs example
above, but this fix is no worse than the use after free that would have
resulted with the previous code.
