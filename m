Agreed. But current solution still looks like the easies way to me to implement 
desired functionality.

Kthreads support in a container is rather a "political" problem, than an 
implementation problem.

Currently, when you call kthread_create(), you add new job to kthreadd queue. 
Kthreadd is unique, starts right after init and lives in global initial 
environment. So, any kthread inherits namespaces from it.
Of course, we can start one kthread per environment and change it's root or even 
network namespace in kthread function. But pid namespace of this kthread will 
remain global.
It looks like not a big problem, when we shutdown kthread by some variable. But 
what about killable nfsd kthreads?
1) We can't kill them from nested pid namespace.
2) How we will differ nfsd kthreads in initial pid namespace?

In OpenVZ we have kthreadd per pid hamespace and it allows us to create kthreads 
(and thus services) per pid namespace.

Unfortunately, changing of pid namespace for kthreads doesn't look like an easy 
trick.
