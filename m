No! guys!

One it will not solve my problem because any
solution that needs to inspect exofs/Kconfig file will
not work if MISC_FILESYSTEMS is not selected and your
solutions involve that.

And two:
All the user needs to do is Select NFS4.1 everything
else should be done automatically. He should not need
to go to misc-filesystems and select ORE so he can have
pnfs-objects. That's a nightmare.

And anyway the current Kernel rule is that a user of a library
needs to select it and all it's dependencies, because select
is not recursive. Now I devised a little skim that can avoid
that, which is not conventional but works very nice. It was
almost good enough only we have the problem that exofs is under
that big MISC_FILESYSTEMS nub.

So It's the regular Kernel way, for now.

(The real solution is to move ORE to lib/ which would enable my
 clever trick. But I don't want to go there only because of that)

I'll fix the typos though

Thanks
