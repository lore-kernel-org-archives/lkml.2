On a quick glance, I've found other functionally similar struct
member names present on the tree:

  __unused __unusedN __reserved __reservedN __reserved_N __resN
  __pad __padN __flr_pad __ifi_pad __tcpm_padN __tcpct_padN

Do you mean you'd like to see patch(es) to rename all those? I'd not
mind providing them, although my immediate concern right now is just
regarding __unused.

There's also __buf in linux/sem.h and __data in linux/socket.h, but
I'd rather not thouch those, as I'd expect to be users for them?

thanks,
guillem
