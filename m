So above we have this

        loff_t cur_offset = dio->block_in_file << dio->blkbits;
        loff_t bio_next_offset = dio->logical_offset_in_bio +
                dio->bio->bi_size;


block_in_file is the logical offset of the current page we are working on.
logical_offset_in_bio is the logical offset of the first page in the bio, plus
bi_size gives us the logical offset that would come next for a contiguous page,
so if cur_offset != bio_next_offset then the range in the bio and the current
page we have are not right next to eachother, so it works just fine.  It's a
little tricky, but

dio->block_in_file - logical offset of current page
dio->logical_offset_in_bio - logical offset of first page added to the bio

So say blocksize of 4k, we do dio to 12k, the first time around
dio->block_in_file is 0, we set dio->cur_page, and move on to the next page, and
bio->block_in_file is set to 1.  We find that dio->cur_page is set, so we do
dio_send_cur_page().  Since !dio->bio we create a new bio, and set
dio->logical_offset_in_bio to 0, since thats the offset of dio->cur_page.  Then
we setup the next cur_page as the page for logical block 1, and
dio->block_in_file gets bumped to 2.  We map the next block and come into
dio_send_cur_page() again.  At this point cur_offset would be 8192...and shit I
just realized what was wrong.  If you change

loff_t cur_offset = dio->block_in_file << dio->blkbits;

to

loff_t cur_offset = dio->cur_page_fs_offset << dio->blkbits;

That should fix the problem.  Sorry guys, I screwed that up.  I'll look at this
again tomorrow after I've had my 2 hours of sleep and see if this all still
makes sense, but I think the above should fixe the performance thing.  As for
the dio->boundary thing, dio_bio_submit() sets dio->boundary to 0, so the same
bio won't be submitted twice.  Thanks,

Josef
