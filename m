We did have a few bugs in that area, and as far as I know they're fixed
(and have stayed fixed!).

The one other thing we've seen at testing events is clients not sending
reclaim_complete: not only is it mandatory (with state to reclaim or
not), it's actually mandatory for servers to fail further operations
until it's sent.  However the problems were all seen with unreleased
client code that the implementors said they'd fix.
