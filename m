Here I have 2 doubts:

1) uselib() after setuid() is a rare pattern.  If it doesn't catch
relatively many programs, then it is only an additional complexity -
addition the check deeply into mm rather than into obvious do_execve().

2) As it touches mmap(), I'm afraid it could affect mmap-based heap
allocations as well.  The problem is that it might be somewhat not
predictable and not repeating event - one time the process did mmap() to
increase the heap, one time it did not because of minor allocation
differences.  The former process would be terminated just after mmap()
failed, the latter would not.  I don't think such uncertainty is good
(even if it is rare).


So, I'm hesitating to call the check in do_mmap_pgoff() "simply more
generic".
