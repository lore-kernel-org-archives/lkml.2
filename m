Okay, so something like the following should solve the problem.  Once
destroy_workqueue() is called, queueing is allowed from only the same
workqueue and flush is repeated until the queue is drained, which
seems to be the right thing to do on destruction regardless of the
SCSI changes.

With the following change, the previous patch should do fine for SCSI
and the ew can be removed.  Please note that the following patch is
still only compile tested.

Are we in agreement now?

Thanks.
