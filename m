Hi Andreas,

I set EXT4_EXT_ZERO_LEN to 16 and run the same benchmark again.  the result
is the same as before.

I notice this commit (3977c965) and it set EXT4_EXT_ZERO_LEN to 7.  But
in commit log, it doesn't describe why this value is set to 7.  As you
said, I believe that the disk writes 64K as easily as as 4k in modern
disk.  So maybe we can consider to set it to 16 or RAID stripe. :)

Regards,
Zheng
