No, that's not the problem we're talking about here.  While it is true
that some devices crash upon receiving RC16, so far we haven't been
sending RC16 to those devices, so they don't matter for the purposes of
this discussion.

In fact, usb-storage already has a NO_READ_CAPACITY_16 flag.  It was
introduced because of a card reader that mistakenly attempts to return
an actual capacity value even when no card is present: It takes the
number of sectors -- which is 0 -- and subtracts 1 as usual.  You can
imagine what happens next.  :-)  That's the only device which
currently has this flag.

The reason for the try_rc_10_first flag is that some devices return
bogus data in response to RC16.  Like, an 800 GB device claiming to
have 3 exabytes.
