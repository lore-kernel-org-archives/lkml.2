Since a sparse file has the holes filled by nulls by definition, it seems 
fairly clear that they chould count as holes. In fact, I would not be 
surprised to see some filesystem _only_ report the unwritten pieces of 
sparse files as holes (not any other ranges of nulls)

the question I have is how large does the range of nulls need to be before 
it's reported as a hole? disk sectors, filesystem blocks, other?
