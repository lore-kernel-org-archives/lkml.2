But I don't seem to see any queued I/O, hmm.

I don't think we do too many unlinks, but there are quite a bit of
renames over existing files (dovecot-2.0 w/mdbox).

It seemes 3.0.7+gregkh's stable-queue queue-3.0 patches seems to be
running fine without blocking at all on this SSD box, so that should
narrow it down significantly.

Hmm, looking at git diff --stat v3.0.7..v3.1-rc10 fs/xfs , maybe not.. :)

Maybe 3.1 fs/xfs would transplant into 3.0 or vice-versa?
