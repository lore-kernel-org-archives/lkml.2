It could ... but that doesn't solve the prink problem or
the /proc/partitions one.  The idea is to allow naive users to identify
their device physically when the system logs something about it.  Having
to describe a manual mapping procedure is very complex for them.

So this is subsystem specific.  For the case of a SCSI enclosure, I can
answer that it's actually burned into the enclosure firmware.  When you
build an enclosure with labels, the label names are stored in a
diagnostic page.  We can actually interrogate the enclosure directly or
use the ses driver to get these names mapped to current devices.

obviously, one device will be root, and it will already be used
as /dev/root, but the proposal isn't to change any name, it's merely to
set "fred" as the preferred name for /dev/root, which is also /dev/sdc
and /dev/disk/by-id/naa-566dce3ddf etc ...

That's initramfs specific.  However, if, in deference to your new
location, we look at dracut, it has a modules directory for plugin
extensions.  The scripts which do the mapping can be inserted there as
an additional rpm.

I'm not sure I understand the question.  a md setup of RAID-1 on fred
and betty would assemble using /dev/disk/by-preferred/fred
and /dev/disk/by-preferred/betty.  Whether the user want's to
call /dev/md0 something pretty is up to them ... it's not a physically
labelled entity, so I'd tend just to leave it with its default name as
the preferred name.
