Subject: [PATCH 4/6] writeback: pay attention to wbc->nr_to_write in write_cache_pages

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

If a filesystem writes more than one page in ->writepage, write_cache_pages
fails to notice this and continues to attempt writeback when wbc->nr_to_write
has gone negative - this trace was captured from XFS:


    wbc_writeback_start: towrt=1024
    wbc_writepage: towrt=1024
    wbc_writepage: towrt=0
    wbc_writepage: towrt=-1
    wbc_writepage: towrt=-5
    wbc_writepage: towrt=-21
    wbc_writepage: towrt=-85

This has adverse effects on filesystem writeback behaviour. write_cache_pages()
needs to terminate after a certain number of pages are written, not after a
certain number of calls to ->writepage are made.  This is a regression
introduced by 17bc6c30cf6bfffd816bdc53682dd46fc34a2cf4 ("vfs: Add
no_nrwrite_index_update writeback control flag"), but cannot be reverted
directly due to subsequent bug fixes that have gone in on top of it.

This commit adds a ->writepage tracepoint inside write_cache_pages() (how the
above trace was generated) and does the revert manually leaving the subsequent
bug fixes intact. ext4 is not affected by this as a previous commit in the
series stops ext4 from using the generic function.
