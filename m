Pfft, I'm blind, sorry, I didn't pay attention to the slab name;
nfs_inode_cache is client-side, not server-side, so nothing I've done 
should affect it one way or the other.

Of course it's not necessarily a bug for the client to cache a lot of
inodes, but millions sounds like a lot for your case?

Are you actually seeing this cause you problems?
