Fair enough. Thanks for the explanation.

Thanks for the test tools, and yes, I will try to test it when I finish
my V2.

Oh, that does mean that we need to change the normal way we handling
xattr set. I am not sure of it. Maybe we need an option in sysfs that
can be tuned so that the user can tell us whether his inline file
content is more important or the xattr. :)

I'd like to defer it to a later version since it means that we still
need to do 2 I/Os for a small file, the same as a ext* file. Having said
that, it does be helpful for a sequence of small file read(file
iteration or tar) if the underlying block device do a good readahead
job. And this should help in the bigalloc case I mentioned in another
thread about changing extent lengh to cluster(the case is when we tar a
kernel source and do 'sync', it is very time-consuming for a bigalloc
volume).

It is a bit complicate than the current code base. So let me first
implement all the suggestions above and then try to investigate whether
it really helps.

Thanks
