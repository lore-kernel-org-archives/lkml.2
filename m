But they aren't doing the same thing, his is discarding already free'd space,
I'm enabling people to de-allocate space in the middle of files, they are two
seperate things.  Of course if the filesystem is TRIM aware the de-allocation
would lead to a TRIM, but not if the filesystem isn't mounted with -o discard.
Hole punching is useful independantly of the ability to do TRIM.  Thanks,

Josef
