The only reasonable use case I can imagine for this feature is one
where someone wants to use a removable storage device (which could be
a USB thumb drive to a USB HDD to a SSD in a USB 3.0 enclosure) as an
interchange device between Unix systems which do not have compatible
uid/gid spaces.

So perhaps the right approach is that we should have an ext2/3/4
read-only feature flag which enforces a default of nosuid and all
files to be read-only and world-readable.  There would be mount
options which could modify this default behaviour so that the files
could be writeable by a particular uid or gid, and another mount
option which would change the permission bits seen for that file
system from 0755/0644 for directories/files to 0700/0600.

Basically, the idea is we should mark the file system in an explicit
way that it is intended for interchange across incompatible uid/gid
spaces, with defaults which minimize security risk.  The fact that all
files become world-readable is potentially a risk, but if the user is
willing to put their private files on a removeable media that could
easily be dropped in a parking lot, or otherwise stolen or lost,
that's a potential risk that they've implicitly accepted in any case;
we might as well make it be explicit.
