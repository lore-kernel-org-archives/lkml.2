Ok, I ran the code w/o ->check_link() again and have a few corrections

This is correct.

Sorry, the symlink should be from sub_child/group2/dst_0/dst_link
-> ../../group1/src_0/

So after re-running this again, I was a bit off about where the OOOPs is
actually occuring.  So, the OOPs does not occur during in the simple
example here with the first unlink(2):

	unlink sub_child/group1/src_0/src_link

but rather after the second unlink(2) is called after the first for
src_link occurs:

	unlink sub_child/group2/dst_0/dst_link

So back to the OOPs with the current TCM code example, on v2.6.36-rc3
this actually triggers a SLUB warning "Object already free" from inside
of TCM code. This is attributed to the releasing a specific LUN ACLs
from the second unlink(2)'s struct config_item_operations->drop_link(),
that the first unlink had already released.  This is because the first
unlink(2) will currently assume that the remaining LUN ACLs are safe to
release because, it still assumes the disabled check_link call.

I am still pretty certain that I had seen an OOPs in fs/configfs/ code
while doing this at some point (perhaps was w/o slub_debug=FZ..?), but
so far I have not been able to trigger an issue in fs/configfs/
directly.

So, I believe that the main issue here is still involving the unlinking
the first symlink (sub_child/group1/src_0/src_link), and then unlinking
the second symlink (sub_child/group2/dst_0/dst_link) which is still
depending upon the first configfs consumer data structures still being
present.

Does this make sense..?
