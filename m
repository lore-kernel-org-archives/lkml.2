Yes, that's right.

No, I think something else is wrong, though I don't know what it would
be.

Émeric, was the bisection result reproducible?  E.g., if you try
building 37a9d912b24f and 37a9d912b24f^ again, does the former
consistently produce and the latter consistently not produce a crashy
system?
