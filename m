We need to update ACL4_VALID_FLAGS to now consider ACL4_MASKED as a
valid flag. This is also needed for userspace. On a related note,
should we move ACL4_MASKED and ACL4_POSIX_MAPPED to be the higher
bits ? That would make sure we will be able to accomodate new flag
value NFSv4 define. Something like
