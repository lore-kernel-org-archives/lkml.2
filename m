I'm aware of that. That part should be taken care of by the call to
invalidate_kernel_vmap_range() which was in both James and my patch.

There is already code in the SUNRPC layer that calls flush_dcache_page()
after writing (although as Russell pointed out earlier, that is
apparently a no-op for non-page cache pages such as these).

Well, it looks as if NOMMU is giving us problems due to the lack of a
vm_map_ram() (see https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26262).

I'd still like to keep the existing code for those architectures that
don't have problems, since that allows us to send 32k READDIR requests
instead of being limited to 4k. For large directories, that is a clear
win.
For the NOMMU case we will just go back to using a single page for
storage (and 4k READDIR requests only). Should I just do the same for
architectures like ARM and PARISC?
