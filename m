It was something in the initrd, that didn't like the symlinks.  It
has been a year or more since I looked at it.  At that point I just
enabled SYSFS_DEPRECATED and moved on.

I still have to test it but it looks like a one liner.  Actually two lines
now that I have to fix the error in symlink creation as well.
