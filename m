It works very simple: just traverse the tree from specified dentry up to current->fs->root.dentry.
Having container in some fully separated mount point is great, of course. But:
1) this is a limitation we really want to avoid. I.e. container can be chrooted into some path like "/root/containers_root/" as in example above.
2) NFSd kthread works in init root environment. But we anyway want to get proper path string in container root, but not in kthreads root.

I don't really understand, how  mountd's root can be wrong. I.e. its' always right as I see it. NFSd kthreads have to swap/use relative path/whatever to 
communicate with proper mountd.
Or I'm missing something?
