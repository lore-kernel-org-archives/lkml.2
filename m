Recommended by *who*?!?  Who dictated that this is the best way to go?

And in the past we've always allowed for local variations of style;
it's never been a strict style nazism.  Linus has always given
maintainers latitude and has frowned on patch churn for churn's sake.

For goodness sake we still have get_fs() and set_fs() in the kernel
code even though we haven't used the actual fs segment register in
over a decade.

And we're arguing over "there must be only one true logging
interface?!?".  This isn't Highlander.
