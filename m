Please do go ahead.

The safest approach might be:
	- leave lockd's signal handling there (just accept that it may
	  behave incorrectly in container case), assuming that's safe.
	- add a printk ("signalling lockd to restart is deprecated",
	  or something) if it's used.

Then eventually we'll remove it entirely.

(But if that doesn't work, it'd likely also be OK just to remove it
completely now.)
