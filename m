Thanks, Oren - all other input is taken into what I'm about to post,

With the new logic (ripped verbatim from Louis' email) such a move
would make the checkpoint_vpids() code a bit uglier.  I'm about to
resend, please let me know if you still want the code moved.

No task will have this nproxy attached before we assign a valid
pid_ns.  The NULL pid_ns is only while it is in the objhash but
not attached to a task.
