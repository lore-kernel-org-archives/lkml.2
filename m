Yes the behavior is different, intentionally so.

Here's a patch to test it out.  I add a sysfs attribute to the host to
tell it to simulate being busy for the specified number of seconds, and
add some debug code so we can see what's happening.

    hpsa: debug retry behavior change
    
    This patch is just for testing.

Now, testing that out, I tell the host to act busy for 20 seconds
(not a likely scenario, but not inconceivable).  Then, I tell it
to rescan for logical drives while it is busy.  With the patch,
to retry 25 times over a longer period of time, here's what happens:

It eventually works.

Now, here is a patch which leaves the debug in, but goes back to the old behavior of just
retrying 3 times immediately then giving up:

    go back to old behavior (immediately give up after 3 quick retries)

Now, the behavior we get is this:

The rescan just doesn't work in the face of even a 1 second BUSY condition with
the old behavior.

Yeah, in the working case, the driver thread is sleeping for a bit.  Note
that this is not in the main i/o path (the scsi mid layer will have to deal with
SAM_STAT_BUSY however it normally does) this retrying is only in paths involving driver
initiated commands, in this case, rescanning for new/changed/removed logical drives.

So yeah, the "echo 1 > /sys/blah/blah/rescan" process will sleep for up to ~20 seconds
in the event of some (presumably very rare) 20 second BUSY condition, but it will work in
cases the old code will not, and so it sleeps 20 secs, I don't think that's really a 
problem, esp. compared to the alternative of just failing.
