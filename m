A quick search gives me:
CVE-2005-3359: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=175769
CVE-2006-3741: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=b8444d00762703e1b6146fce12ce2684885f8bf6

And actually an earlier discussion you were actually involved in:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/7/16/300

If it's inexpensive and helps defend against problems, it seems sensible to
add to me.
