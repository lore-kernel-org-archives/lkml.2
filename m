Erp, you're right.

(The fix is still right, it's the changelog that's wrong; happy to
fix and resend if it's wanted....)

We do want to break leases at least in the O_NONBLOCK case so that a
caller can make forward progress by retrying open(.,O_NONBLOCK).

In the other cases I don't think there's any logic to the current
behavior.  Something like:

-	if (IS_ERR(new_fl) && !i_have_this_lease
-			&& ((mode & O_NONBLOCK) == 0)) {
-		error = PTR_ERR(new_fl);
-		goto out;
-	}
-
...
 		error = -EWOULDBLOCK;
 		goto out;
 	}
-
+	if (IS_ERR(new_fl)) {
+		error = PTR_ERR(new_fl);
+		goto out;
+	}
 restart:
 	break_time = flock->fl_break_time;
 	if (break_time != 0) {

would be a little less convoluted.

Or we could just do it the really obvious way:

 	new_fl = lease_alloc(NULL, want_write ? F_WRLCK : F_RDLCK);
+	if (IS_ERR(new_fl))
+		return PTR_ERR(new_fl);
 
 	lock_flocks();
... 
-	if (IS_ERR(new_fl) && !i_have_this_lease
-			&& ((mode & O_NONBLOCK) == 0)) {
-		error = PTR_ERR(new_fl);
-		goto out;
-	}
-

Then you're returning -ENOMEM in a case when we really didn't need to do
an allocation, but is that really a problem?  It's a rare case, and
opens can already fail with -ENOMEM for other reasons, and I'd rather
not have the extra hair.

?
