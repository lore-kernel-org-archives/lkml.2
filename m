OK, agreed, __wait_event_interruptible() was a bad example.

Yes, this is only needed for the code which doesn't check
signal_pending() "properly", or doesn't check it at all before
schedule(). OK, say, wait_for_completion_interruptible().
Or schedule_timeout_interruptible().

I suspect we have a lot more examples. Historically linux allows to
set TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and schedule() without any checks.

Yes, I don't think we can remove it.

Or at least rename it ;)

Perhaps.

Or we can add TASK_FREEZABLE (like TASK_WAKEKILL), iirc we already
discussed this some time ago. And probably it makes sense to add the
generic wait_event_state().

Oleg.
