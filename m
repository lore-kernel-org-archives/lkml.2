Every NFS import from all this server's clients has 'vers=3' forced on
(for now, until I get around to figuring out what if anything needs to
be done to move to NFSv4: it may be the answer is 'nothing' but I tread
quite carefully with this server, since my $HOME is there).

/proc/fs/nfsfs/volumes on the clients confirms that everything is v3.

Nope (other than upgrading the clients to 3.6.3 in concert). Running
3.6.1 here on that server now and 3.6.3 on all the clients, and no crash
in over a day.

nfs-utils is a bit old, 1.2.6-rc6, I should probably upgrade it...

I'll try rebooting into it again soon, and get an oops report if it
should happen again (and hopefully less filesystem corruption this time,
right after a reboot into a new kernel was clearly the wrong time to
move a bunch of directories around).

Sorry for the continuing lack of useful information... I'll try to fix
that shortly (once with a report of a false alarm, since I really want
this stable kernel: my server is affected by the tx stalls fixed by
3468e9d and I'm getting tired of the frequent 1s lags talking to it: I
could just apply that one fix, but I'd rather track this down properly).
