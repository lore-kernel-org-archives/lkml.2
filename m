I agree that in many cases there won't be a reasonable condition.
In which case, using "1" and an explanatory comment makes sense.
In other cases, the fact that the value is zero can mean that no one
else can possibly have a reference.

All that aside, I fully expect that uses of rcu_access_pointer() will
require more than the usual code-review effort, as these sorts of
unprotected accesses are notoriously error-prone.

Glad you like it!
