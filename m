I think the necessary algorithm is simpler than that:

Send RC10 (unless the device supports PI, in which case it's probably
	enterprisey and well-tested)
Send RC16
If RC10 capacity agrees with RC16 capacity, use extra RC16 data.
(for values of "agrees with" that include the "-1 to use RC16" indicator)

Sure, it's one extra command, but really, who cares?
