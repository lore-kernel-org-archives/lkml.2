Umm. That just smells like BS to me.

The "extensive testing" part was clearly not true, and it seems that
SCSI people sometimes forget that the biggest user (by *far*) is the
USB storage layer.

Also, your protection claim seems to be invalidated by the actual
code. Yes, it checks if the device claims to support protection. But
it *also* says "let's do that 16b command if "scsi_level >
SCSI_SPC_2". So your claim that it hedges around it by looking at the
inquiry data is pure crap. It's simply not true. Just look at the
code:

        if (sdp->host->max_cmd_len < 16)
                return 0;
        if (sdp->try_rc_10_first)
                return 0;
        if (sdp->scsi_level > SCSI_SPC_2)
                return 1;
        if (scsi_device_protection(sdp))
                return 1;
        return 0;

Notice how for high enough scsi_levels, it never even gets to that
scsi_device_protection() check, which does indeed look into protection
data.

So no, I simply don't see the careful testing or the checking that you
claim exists.
