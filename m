The way that Jeff set it up, it's completely parallel to eg congestion
or unplugging. So that should be easily doable.

That's a bit of a problem. Say the queue has one request left, it'll
service that and the start idling. But we already got this hint that we
should yield, but as it happened before we reached the idling state,
we'll not yield. Perhaps it would be better to mark the cfqq as yielding
if it isn't ready to yield just yet.
