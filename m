Changes for nfsd (and also a few file-locking changes) are available in
the git repository at:

	git://linux-nfs.org/~bfields/linux.git for-3.2

This is the same tree I've always used--I assume you believe it's mine
without a need for signing anything.  Feel free to tell me otherwise.

A voice in my head says "wait wait X Y and Z are ready Any Day Now!",
and I'm silencing that voice by pretending I may send another (much
smaller) pull request in a week.  Don't count on it.  Anyway:

In this request, among other work:

	- A rewrite of large parts of the NFSv4 state management to fix
	  bugs and make the code more mantainable.  One of the goals was
	  to break up the big state lock--unfortunately I didn't get
	  there, but it looks close.

	- Several 4.1 fixes from Benny Halevy--thanks to Benny for
	  testing the server at the fall bakeathon.

	- Progress on the basic 4.1 todo's.  Thanks in particular to Mi
	  Jinlong for (among other things) implementing the somewhat
	  tricky DRC limit checking.

	  The 4.1 code is getting closer--it *might* be possible to
	  finish basic 4.1 early as 3.3, at which point we could start
	  on optional features (like pNFS).  But that will depend on
	  people sending patches (and pynfs tests) for the remaining 4.1
	  todo's.

	- Fix for longstanding problems with duplicate directory cookies
	  from ext3/4, from Bernd Schubert.  (One nfsv4-specific patch
	  only in this pull, I believe the rest is going through the
	  ext4 tree.)

	- From Trond (and Chuck), kernel support for federated NFS.

	- Fixes and some cleanup for vfs lease code.  I've deferred a
	  larger change to fix lease semantics for NFSv4 after
	  discovering those "fixes" aren't actually correct for Samba
	  (the only other user I know of), and instead I intend to
	  introduce a new lock type for NFSv4's use.

Plus some other miscellaneous bug fixes--thanks to everyone who reported
a bug or contributed a patch!

--b.
