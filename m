One nfsd 4.1 bugfix, and two more bits of mopup from the lease de-BKL
work.  (The last of which is really just cleanup--but obvious enough I
hoped to slip it past the functional-regressions-only-post-rc1
filter....)

J. Bruce Fields (3):
      nfsd4: fix 4.1 connection registration race
      locks: fix leak on merging leases
      locks: remove dead lease error-handling code

    locks: remove dead lease error-handling code
    
    A minor oversight from f7347ce4ee7c65415f84be915c018473e7076f31,
    "fasync: re-organize fasync entry insertion to allow it under a
    spinlock": this cleanup-on-error was only needed to handle -ENOMEM.  Now
    that we're preallocating it's unneeded.

    locks: fix leak on merging leases
    
    We must also free the passed-in lease in the case it wasn't used because
    an existing lease was upgrade/downgraded or already existed.
    
    Note the nfsd caller doesn't care because it's fl_change callback
    returns an error in those cases.

    nfsd4: fix 4.1 connection registration race
    
    If a connection is closed just after a sequence or create_session
    is sent over it, we could end up trying to register a callback that will
    never get called since the xprt is already marked dead.
