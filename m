I agree it's tricky.

You can still block those in other ways, seccompv2 could be one.

The whole point of capabilities, SELinux, etc. is micromanaging privileged
apps.  Linux has gone beyond the Unix philosophy, it seems.

Besides, privileged apps can and do use capabilities to micromanage
themselves.  Sure, ioperm/iopl do mean that a compromised CAP_SYS_RAWIO app
has free reins.  However, until that app is compromised, it may like to get
help from the OS in making effective use of access control.

What is the exact use case for this, where you wouldn't have gotten an
fd for /dev/foo in the first place?  And what command do you want to
send to the disk?  The only "valid" case found in the wild was using
SG_IO to send "SYNCHRONIZE CACHE", which is wrong anyway (does not
flush the OS cache).  fdatasync could and should have been used instead.
