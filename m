I think these are _relatively_ cheap considering that it's execve().
If we can do e.g. 10 million of atomic64_inc_return()'s per second (and
I think we can do a lot more, although I did not benchmark this), but
only 10000 of execve()'s per second, then the performance impact is 0.1%.
I admit that 0.1% is significant, but I used worst-case guesstimates
here; the actual number might be more like 0.01% (50 million vs. 5 thousand)
or even 0.002% (200 million vs. 4 thousand).  (200 million is 15 CPU
cycles at 3 GHz, which may be a reasonable optimistic estimate.
4 thousand is a realistic execve() speed for dynamically-linked programs.)

This makes sense to me.  We just need to ensure that the per-CPU counter
is still large enough that it won't wrap.  56 bits is enough
(considering that the attack has to run on a single CPU of the target
system, unlike e.g. an attack on a cipher with a 56-bit key could be),
but there's little room for reducing this further (such as to support
many more than 256 CPUs in a system).  So if we use this approach, maybe
we should simply keep a 64-bit per-CPU counter and a 32-bit CPU number,
for a 96-bit id.  This may even be faster on execve() (no need to
combine the two values into one).

I don't know which one of these approaches has lower overhead on current
systems.  My _guess_ is that atomic64_inc_return() may well be faster in
many cases.
