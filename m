Do you mean we don't care about breaking ide code?

struct request {
        ....
        unsigned int cmd_flags;
        enum rq_cmd_type_bits cmd_type;

Another reason I didn't reuse REQ_TYPE_PM_SUSPEND/REQ_TYPE_PM_RESUME is
because all scsi requests set the cmd_type to REQ_TYPE_BLOCK_PC.

So I think we should add a new cmd_flags(REQ_PM) to tell if it's a
runtime pm request.

Thanks.
