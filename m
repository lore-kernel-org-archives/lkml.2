I don't know enough about the ATA subsystem to say much, except that 
this looks more logical.

Yes, it is a problem.  But it looks like the underlying issue is that
you're using the SCSI error handler to do something it was not intended
for.  Can't you suspend and resume the ATA port without using the error
handler?
