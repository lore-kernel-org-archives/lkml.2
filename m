Of course.  It allows us to present at kernel summit and look for early
rejections to save us all some time (which we did, at the container
mini-summit readout at ksummit 2008), but it would be silly to read
anything more into it than that.

100% agreed.

Here's where we disagree.  If you are right about a viable userland
alternative ('already working' isn't even a preqeq in my opinion,
so long as it is really viable), then I'm with you, but I'm not buying
it at this point.

Seriously.  Truly.  Honestly.  I am *not* looking for any extra kernel
work at this moment, if we can help it in any way.
