In that old sf.net wiki you say:
Why use Next3 snapshots and not LVM snapshots?
* Performance: only small overhead to write performance with snapshots

Fair claim against current LVM snapshot (but not multisnap).

In this thread you're being very terse on the performance hit you
assert multisnap has that ext4 snapshots does not.  Can you please be
more specific?

In your most recent post it seems you're focusing on "LVM snapshots"
and attributing the deficiencies of old-style LVM snapshots
(non-shared exception store causing N-way copy-out) to dm-multisnap?

Again, nobody will dispute that the existing dm-snapshot target has
poor performance that requires snapshots be short-lived.  But
multisnap does _not_ suffer from those performance problems.
