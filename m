I think nfsd can simply update current_nfsd_time whenever the mtime it
reads from an inode is >= current_nfsd_time.  (The invariant you need
to maintain is that whenever nfsd reads an mtime, any timestamps
produced after that have a later time.  So just code it that way
directly.)

I believe this works.

But I do not believe this works.

1) Modify file A
2) Modify file B
3) File A experiences one of those "occasional forward jumps in mtime"
(inode evicted + read back within 1 second)
4) mtimes on A and B are now out of order -- very bad

As Bruce mentioned, ext3 is a lost cause.

Regardless of any of this, however, the first step is to provide a
mount option to select the timestamp algorithm...  Because it is still
absurd that I cannot have accurate timestamps on my files here in the
21st century.

Once that is done, the rest is just providing the alternative
implementations and choosing defaults.
