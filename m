OK, since it seems that lustre uses xattr heavily, I will try my best to
avoid the performance regression for xattr operations.

Thanks for the info.

btw, I have another idea about using the not-used extent space for
storing inline data like what we do for a symlink. So I will still use a
xattr entry to indicate whether the inode will have inline data or not.
If yes, the initialized xattr value len will be zero while the extent
space(60 bytes) will be used to store the inline data. And if the file
size is larger than 60, it will begin to insert xattr values. In such
case, we supports inline data and don't use too much space after the
i_extra_isize. What do you think of it?

Thanks
Tao
