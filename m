Sorry, I grossly misspoke.  Of course crc16 can't guarantee the ability to
detect all possible errors in any data block larger than 16 bits.  What I meant
to say is that I wasn't sure what is the maximum number of bit errors that
crc16 polynomials can detect given a message length of 32768+32+128 bits.

In particular, I remember reading on the wikipedia page[1] that for polynomials
with odd numbers of terms (such as ansi crc16), the period for 2-bit errors is
65535 bits as you say; but as I recall, those polynomials also can't detect all
errors involving odd numbers of bit flips.  For polynomials with even numbers
of terms (such as the t10dif one) the period in which it can detect 2-bit
errors is 32767 bits, but on the other hand they can detect odd numbers of
errors.

The people who study error rates on disk hardware at IBM tell me that bit flips
are more common than you'd like, though I was also looking for something that
can tell me if blocks are being written to the wrong places.
