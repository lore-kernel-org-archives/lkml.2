Thanks for the patch and the detailed explanation.

No, not really. Attaching from outside to a shell running in a container
and running a command yields:

| rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [INT CHLD], [], 8) = 0
| pipe([3, 4])                            = 0
| clone(Process 2581 attached (waiting for parent)
| Process 190 attached

Without the patch the order of reported pids is reversed (and at least
with the patched kernel the outside pid is consistently reported first)

| child_stack=0, flags=CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID|CLONE_CHILD_SETTID|SIGCHLD, child_tidptr=0xb7713708) = 190
| [pid  2549] setpgid(190, 190)           = 0
| [pid  2549] rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [], NULL, 8) = 0
| [pid  2549] rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD], [], 8) = 0
| [pid  2549] close(3)                    = 0
| [pid  2549] close(4)                    = 0
| [pid  2549] rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD TSTP TTIN TTOU], [CHLD], 8) = 0
| [pid  2549] ioctl(255, TIOCSPGRP, [190]) = 0
| [pid  2549] rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [CHLD], NULL, 8) = 0
| [pid  2549] rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [], NULL, 8) = 0
| [pid  2549] rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD], [], 8) = 0
| [pid  2549] waitpid(-1, Process 2549 suspended

(the shell hangs here)

^C <unfinished ...>
| Process 2549 detached
| Process 2581 detached
| Process 190 detached

(the command executes here normally).
