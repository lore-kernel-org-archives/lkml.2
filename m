Doesn't Jeff's recovery mechanism resolve this situation?  The client does a fresh lookup, so shouldn't it get the new FH at that point?  If there is no possible way for the client to discover the new FH, then ESTALE recovery should probably be finite.

Retrying forever is bad only if we think there are cases where there is no possible recovery action for the client, or the ESTALE signals a condition that is not temporary.

It is temporary, for instance, when an administrator takes an exported volume offline; at some point, that volume will be brought back online.  Maybe it is better generally for the client to retry indefinitely instead of causing applications to fail.

Retrying forever is exactly what we do for "hard" NFS mounts, for example, and for many types of NFSv4 state recovery.  Philosophically, how is this situation different?

It would be reasonable, at least, to insert a backoff delay in the retry logic.
