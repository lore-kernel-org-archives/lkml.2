That's the most compelling argument.

I want to keep the structure version, just in case we need to expand fields in
the stat struct in future.  Otherwise we may need to create yet another stat
syscall.

The potential problem with passing the flags as a syscall argument is that
we're then limited to a single 32-bit integer.  It might be enough, but if I
do as at least one person has suggested and assign each field in the struct
its own bit, that uses up half right there, plus I'd like to add at least one
operational flag (to force synchronisation with the server).

I would like the size argument for two reasons: firstly, to prevent buffer
overruns and, secondly, because I can see some scope for variable-size fields
(such as for volume IDs or security labels), though the latter might be better
handled through getxattr() (which would mean extra overhead).
