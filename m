Ok, thank you, Jeff.
It looks like no mentions about portmapper are present in RFC's for NFS versions 
4.* after a brief look.
This SVC_SOCK_ANONYMOUS is understandable and can't be removed with this 
patch-set from my pow.
But now I strongly believe, that we can move this vs_hidden flag from 
svc_version to svc_program structure and set it for both NFSv4.* programs.
Hope, someone else will confirm of refute this statement.
