Read the rest of the thread... Jim and Nick already made this point, and
I've replied.

The fact of the matter is that most application writers remain blithely
oblivious of the need to fsync() as the ext4 people know all to well:
see the attempts to impose the fully posix-compatible 'data=writeback'
mode as the default and the catastrophe that occurred when
'data=ordered' semantics changed for the rename() syscall. Adding new
failure modes needs to be done with care, or GNOME will crash and/or
your word processor _will_ lose your last hour or so of work.

They are a workaround to the problem of users failing to plan ahead
and/or jobs not running as quickly as originally scheduled. You can run
them if you feel safe doing so, but they should not be a mandatory
feature to ensure data isn't lost during normal operation.

BTW: instead of trying to change existing kernel and gssd semantics, why
not concentrate on adding the equivalent of krenewd/kstart?

So that the kernel can flush out any dirty data while the ticket is
valid, and block further asynchronous read/write operations (either by
making them synchronous, or by returning an appropriate error). We may
also want to consider closing open file state and possibly freeing up
locks so that other processes with valid credentials may still access
the data.

IOW: that allows for an _orderly_ failure mode instead of the current
catastrophic mode. The application gets a chance to deal with any errors
_before_ the data is lost.
