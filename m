The solution appears to be to twiddle with /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes 
and /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches, though I'm not sure this addresses the 
root cause. Perhaps low memory really is the root cause.

At any rate, their solution was to set min_free_kbytes to 4GB, and to 
'echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' whenever free memory fell below 8GB. 
Not particularly elegant, but it appears to have stopped their server 
from wedging.
