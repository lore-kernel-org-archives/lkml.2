Hole punching was not included originally in fallocate() for a
variety of reasons. IIRC, they were along the lines of:

	1 de-allocating of blocks in an allocation syscall is wrong.
	  People wanted a new syscall for this functionality.
	2 no glibc interface needs it
	3 at the time, only XFS supported punching holes, so there
	  is not need to support it in a generic interface
	4 the use cases presented were not considered compelling
	  enough to justify the additional complexity (!)

In the end, I gave up arguing for it to be included because just
getting the FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE functionality was a hard enough
battle.

Anyway, #3 isn't the case any more, #4 was just an excuse not to
support anything ext4 couldn't do and lots of apps are calling
fallocate directly (because glibc can't use FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE) so
#2 isn't an issue, either. I guess that leaves #1 to be debated;
I don't think there is any problem with doing what you propose.

What I will suggest is that this requires a generic xfstest to be
written and support added to xfs_io to enable that test (and others)
to issue hole punches. Something along the lines of test 242 which I
wrote for testing all the edge case of XFS_IOC_ZERO_RANGE (*) would be
good.

Cheers,

Dave.
