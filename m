*BSD didn't. They just added something that was useful to UNIX.
I'd be happy with that. We don't need to ape Windows in everything.
The coming ACL disaster will show that (we will go from an ACL
model that is slightly too complex to use, to one that is impossibly

No, we'd be querying an additional EA. The EA we query contains
the DOS attribues as well as the create time.
