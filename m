I've looked at GFS2 a bit now and I think that the warning is bogus:

kconfig complains with:
warning: (TARGET_CORE && GFS2_FS) selects CONFIGFS_FS which has unmet direct dependencies (SYSFS)

but the "select" is conditional:
config GFS2_FS
	tristate "GFS2 file system support"
	depends on (64BIT || LBDAF)
	select DLM if GFS2_FS_LOCKING_DLM
	select CONFIGFS_FS if GFS2_FS_LOCKING_DLM
	select SYSFS if GFS2_FS_LOCKING_DLM

and the same condition selects both SYSFS and CONFIGFS_FS.  Furthermore, the
conditional is not true, so neither of them is being selected/enabled.
Looks like a minor kconfig buglet to me.
