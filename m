Yes I did run into something similar.  I found 2 cases that involved EOF:
1. A truncate shortens EOF, but only zeroed to the end of the block, but 
not to the end of the page.  This was corrected by "[PATCH 5/6 v7] ext4: 
fix fsx truncate failure"

2. A write extends EOF, but does not zero all of the page beyond EOF, 
and that was what "[PATCH 6/6 v7] ext4: fix partial page writes" was 
supposed to address.

I am still digging through tracing output at the moment, so I dont have 
a very good explanation right now, but I will keep folks posted if I 
find something.
