It seems to happen across all directories, these are from the past 24 hours.

Interestingly, I have two machines that perform this function, both XFS and it 
only affects the client running 2.6.38:

$ df -h
2.6.38 - Has a kernel driver that was removed in 2.6.39 (rt2870sta) which
works really well.
atomw:/d1              30G   13G   18G  43% /nfs/atomw/d1

2.6.39:
d630w:/d1              75G  2.6G   72G   4% /nfs/d630w/d1

However, to rule out any kernel issues I'll try 3.0 and see if the problem recurs with a newer version as it is _NOT_ happening with 2.6.39 (similar setup) on both; however:

d630 => 32bit installation (core2duo t7500)
atomw => 64-bit atom
