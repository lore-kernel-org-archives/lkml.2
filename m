  Nigel is right that threads are meant to be freezable. If below patch
is needed for that, you have my ack.

  Just two notes:
1) Freezing the journal thread will effectively block filesystem activity
(not immediately but once transaction fills up) so you should better make
sure you don't need to do anything with the filesystem after freezing the
thread.

2) Is freezing journal thread still needed when we freeze filesystem in
suspend code? Because no IO should happen once filesystem is frozen...
