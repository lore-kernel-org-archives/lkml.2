I knew it was a mistake for me to try to figure out what the
proper reference should be.  If such things change, maybe 
having a reference in there at all is a mistake.  Maybe it should just
say something like, "the numbers correspond to the entries in
the scsi_device_types[] array in drivers/scsi/scsi.c" since 
that file is more likely to be close at hand than whichever
spec we might refer to.
