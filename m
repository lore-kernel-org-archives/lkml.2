Wow...a small part of me says 'well said', on the basis that your
assertions are true, but I do think there needs to be more
constructivity in such critique; it is almost impossible to be a great
engineer and a great academic at once in a time-pressured environment.

If you can produce some specific and suggestions with code references,
I'm sure we'll get some good discussion with potential to improve from
where we are.

Thanks,
