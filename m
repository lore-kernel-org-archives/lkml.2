I'd be happy to take a stab at this.  This solves most of the ABI 
reservations that I have with this v1 patchset.

Looking at netconsole, it looks to lack some locking for data 
consistency, and it appears that we will deadlock if we ever get a 
NETDEV_UNREGISTER event (due to recursively grabbing the rtnl in 
netpoll_cleanup).  I have a couple patches I've been hacking on this 
afternoon that should clear those issues up.

I'm thinking of pushing all the target handling options down into 
net/core/netpoll.c.  I'll probably expose this interface as "struct 
netpoll_targets" where ->lock and ->list could be completely exposed to 
clients.  netconsole would then get a lot smaller as would netoops.

True.  We call this code 'netdump' or 'network_dumper' internally, but I 
figured it'd be better to follow current conventions with ramoops and 
mtdoops already in the tree.  I don't really care what it's called in 
the end :)

The trouble with Oopses is just that:  We don't know whether we can 
safely survive them or not and it's a total gamble each time we do Oops. 
  We can't programmatically know how crapped out the machine is, so 
historically we've erred on not allowing bad things to continue 
happening once someone notices something wrong.

It's easier for us to just shoot the machine in the head (panic_on_oops) 
and move on than corrupt data or dead-lock in weird ways at some later 
point in time.  This is definitely not the behaviour I would want nor 
expect from my desktop or phone, but for the cluster, it's just safer.
