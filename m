Looks like this problem was isolated to a single VM and root
filesystem. I could not reproduce it on anything other than the
one filesystem that was failing.

Unfortunately, I had a fat-fingered moment and backed up the wrong
filesystem image at the outset. So after I smashed the original
filesystem into oblivion (one failure lead to half the filesystem in
lost+found), I had nothing to restore from to continue testing.

So I re-imaged the root filesystem and the problem has not occurred
despite trying for more than a day. When it was bad, it didn't take
more than a few minutes of activity to reproduce. Hence I can only
conclude there was something wrong with the filesystem itself that
wasn't being detected, not some more generic problem....

I'll go add this to the bugzilla and close it down.

Cheers,

Dave.
