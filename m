Nope not that i know off, with kernel 3.4.0 ...
When trying to scp/sftp some files to a ext4 filesystem on a LVM partition, makes it readonly within a few seconds:

May 27 21:17:23 serveerstertje kernel: [  880.140374] EXT4-fs error (device dm-42): ext4_mb_generate_buddy:741: group 1699, 32254 clusters in bitmap, 32258 in gd
May 27 21:17:23 serveerstertje kernel: [  880.147052] Aborting journal on device dm-42-8.
May 27 21:17:23 serveerstertje kernel: [  880.263201] EXT4-fs (dm-42): Remounting filesystem read-only
May 27 21:17:23 serveerstertje kernel: [  880.276990] EXT4-fs (dm-42): ext4_da_writepages: jbd2_start: 1673 pages, ino 7847939; err -30
May 27 21:17:23 serveerstertje kernel: [  880.321661] EXT4-fs error (device dm-42): ext4_journal_start_sb:328: Detected aborted journal

It's quite a pain in the ass ... and not fixed nor tracked down, it's not clear if its a ext4 problem, lvm/dm or the combination.
