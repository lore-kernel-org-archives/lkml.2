  Yes, I've noticed this while writing the email but forgot to update the

  And indeed your read-only checks are racy the same way freezing was...
But that's a different story. You have actually a good point that freezing
protection and read-only mount protection should be at the same places.

  That's just not true. Remember older versions of this patch set. Old
model is doing:
   freeze data
   sync
   freeze metadata (via freezing transations)
and it is broken mainly because while sync is running, new metadata are
dirtied and thus you end up with dirty metadata on a frozen filesystem.
Forcing the journal commit in ->freeze_fs() pushes changes to disk but
inodes still remain dirty and actually, it can be too late for flusher
thread anyway because it can be already hanging trying to start a
transaction.

Then there are also other less severe problems like that mark_inode_dirty()
could race with freezing in such a way that it was added to dirty list
after filesystem was fully frozen.

  "all the places" in my sentence meant "including the internal sources of
modification"...

  I think there are two different issues. One is your complaint that
extending the shell to cover also internal sources of fs modification will
be too fragile if not done implicitely on transaction start.

Another is a question whether we could reasonably fend off internal
modification using the current two counters. The MRU thread or ->release
can be easily handled with them (->release can be handled by the counter
ranking below mmap_sem). For shrinkers, I'm not that certain. Certainly the
outer counter won't work. The inner one with lock ranking just below
mmap_sem might work - depends on whether there are any XFS locks under
mmap_sem from within which we'd do GFP_KERNEL allocations. But here I agree
issues might be nasty enough to warrant another counter.

This is connected with another somewhat related issue: Do we want shrinkers
to block on frozen filesystem? That could result in unrelated processes
blocking on frozen filesystem. I'd find it nicer if we just skipped
the writes if the filesystem is frozen as it seems to me
xfs_free_eofblocks() is somewhat optional. Is it true?

  The two counters are needed to avoid deadlocks, not just because of
lockdep... The third counter can be added but per-cpu counters are not
exactly cheap (in terms of memory) so I don't want to add it without a good
reason. Lock ordering constraints in shrinkers might be this good reason.

Also fitting the XFS transaction system to freezing was a bit ugly (because
you need to log a dummy transaction on a frozen filesystem and you have
things like xfs_trans_dup() which requires us to bump the counter even
though the filesystem is already in freezing process) so I'd be happier if
we could avoid it...
