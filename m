Yes, I've seen this.  We use xfs for quite long time.  The on-board
controller does not have battery unit, so it should be no different
than a software raid array or single drive.

But I traced the issue to a particular workload -- see $subject.

Simple test doing random reads or writes of 4k blocks in a 1Gb
file located on an xfs filesystem, Mb/sec:

                      sync  direct
              read   write   write
2.6.27 xfs   1.17    3.69    3.80
2.6.32 xfs   1.26    0.52    5.10
                      ^^^^
2.6.32 ext3  1.19    4.91    5.02

Note the 10 times difference between O_SYNC and O_DIRECT writes
in 2.6.32.  This is, well, huge difference, and this is where
the original slowdown comes from, apparently.  In 2.6.27 both
sync and direct writes are on-par with each other, in .32
direct write has improved, but sync write is just pathetic now.
And compared with previous o_sync, that's about 6 times the
difference which I reported previously.

We're running a legacy oracle application here, on Oracle8,
which does not support O_DIRECT and uses O_SYNC.  So it gets
hit by this issue quite badly - no doubt users start screaming
after switching to .32.

I also tested ext3fs, for comparison.  This one does not have
that problem and works just fine in both .32 and .27.  I also
tried disabling barriers for xfs, which made no difference
whatsoever.

So it's O_SYNC writes on XFS which are problematic.  Together
with hw raid apparently, since no one noticed when I switched
other machines (with sw raid) from .27 to .32.

I'll _try_ to find when the problem first appeared, but it is
not that simple since I've only very small time window for
testing.

Thanks!
