I should have read more.  :(  More questions follow:

* Does the Areca have a battery backed write cache?
* Are you crashing or rebooting cleanly?
* Do you see log recovery messages in the logs for this filesystem?

ok journal_async_commit is off the reservation a bit; that's really not
tested, and Jan had serious reservations about its safety.

* Can you reproduce this w/o journal_async_commit?
