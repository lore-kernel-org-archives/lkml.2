Dave,

Just another example where serialization is taking place with ext4.

I created a group with 1MB/s write limit and ran tedso's fsync tester
program with little modification. I used write() system call instead
of pwrite() so that file size grows. This program basically writes
1MB of data and then fsync's it and then measures the fsync time.

I ran two instances of prgram in two groups on two separate files. One
instances is throttled to 1MB/s and other is in root group unthrottled.

Unthrottled program gets serialized behind throttled one. Following
are fsync times.

Throttled instance	Unthrottled Instance
------------------ 	--------------------
fsync time: 1.0051	fsync time: 1.0067
fsync time: 1.0049	fsync time: 1.0075
fsync time: 1.0048	fsync time: 1.0063
fsync time: 1.0073	fsync time: 1.0062
fsync time: 1.0070	fsync time: 1.0078
fsync time: 1.0032	fsync time: 1.0049
fsync time: 0.0154	fsync time: 1.0068
fsync time: 0.0137	fsync time: 1.0048

Without any throttling both the instances do fine
-------------------------------------------------
Throttled instance	Unthrottled Instance
------------------ 	--------------------
fsync time: 0.0139	fsync time: 0.0162
fsync time: 0.0132	fsync time: 0.0156
fsync time: 0.0149	fsync time: 0.0169
fsync time: 0.0165	fsync time: 0.0152
fsync time: 0.0188	fsync time: 0.0135
fsync time: 0.0137	fsync time: 0.0142
fsync time: 0.0148	fsync time: 0.0149
fsync time: 0.0168	fsync time: 0.0163
fsync time: 0.0153	fsync time: 0.0143

So when we are inreasing the size of file and fsyncing it, other
unthrottled instances of similar activities will get throttled
behind it.

IMHO, this is a problem and should be fixed. If filesystem can fix it great.
But if not, then we should consider the option of throttling buffered writes 
in balance_dirty_pages().

Following is the test program.
