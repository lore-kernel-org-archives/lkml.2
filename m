Hi Kyungmin,

generally I think this is a good idea and I thought about it as well.
However I also think that we might want to wait for the FITRIM and
discard supported devices to settle down to see how it performs and if
frequently calling discard on big chunks of the device does not have
some unwanted consequences (as Dave Chinner pointed out in a different
thread, that this automations usually do).

Regarding events, filesystem might watch amount of data written to it
(and it usually do right now) and trigger the event when it exceeds,
let's say 50% of the fs size and zero the counter. The downside of this
is that it is not controlled behaviour hence we'll end up with
unpredictable behaviour of the filesystem in the long term.

The solution might be (and it is something I want to look into)
infrastructure to determine size of the queue to the device from within
the filesystem (or vfs) so we can tell when it is busy and we want to wait,
or when it is doing nothing and we can discard.

Also per filesystem, or per device, control will be needed, so we can
selectively turn it on and off. But as I said I am not sure that this is
the best idea to do it right now, but others might have different
opinion.

Thanks!
