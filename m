What kernel were you running successfully previously?

I saw similar on BL460cG7 on Friday with 3.1-rc4,
but I'm not sure the problem is in the driver.  
I installed rhel6.1, then put 3.1-rc4 on.  Turning off
"Virtualization" in the kernel config seemed to help
(allowed it to boot) and so I thought that must have
been the source of the issue.  So, you might try that.

However, I rebooted that machine just now, and
now I am getting the similar "hpsa 0000:0c:00.0: resetting device 0:0:0:0"
message, so that's pretty weird.

The cmd_alloc failure, I didn't see, but I may have missed it
(didn't have console directed to serial output.)

cmd_alloc failing is not generally expected, as we reserve enough
commands that the upper layers should never exhaust them all (should
honor hpsa's max request limit), so that's pretty weird that
you're seeing that.

I am able to run 3.1-rc3 on rhel6 just fine on other systems (DL380g7,
for example) and I don't think there are any hpsa changes between rc3
and rc4.  (haven't tried rc4 on the dl380g7 yet).

So, I'm not sure what's going on with the BL460c yet, but I am
aware of the problem and have already seen it.  I can't think of
any driver changes lately which should be causing such
changes in behavior.
