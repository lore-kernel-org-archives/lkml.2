looks like your qemu WRITE_SAME patch isn't completed :)

You implement WRITE_SAME as if it doesn't do any data transfer. So
qemu scsi driver gets resid.

The reason why WRITE_SAME works now is that scsi-ml doesn't care about
resid with PC commands but it cares with FS commands.

I confirmed that qemu scsi driver gets the identical command with both
PC and FS commands and qemu calls xfsctl.

Seems that I finished discard FS conversion. I'll update it on the top
of James' uprep patchset soon.
