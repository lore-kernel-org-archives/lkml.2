Updating /cvs/gentoo-x86 seemed to trigger it; it is a rather large
collection of small files. Basic contents visible here:
http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/

Unlike Nick however, I do not have a specific "this does it 100% of the
time" command. At least, I updated CVS again after it died roughly 90%
in; after deleting the directories CVS was unhappy with the sync
completed.
Syncing CVS too often would be a bit unfair on the server at the other
end, so I will try this again tomorrow.

I will sift through my quick snaps now to see if it is legible enough to
type it out for you. More news in half an hour or so.
