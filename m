Detecting mount points is best done by comparing st_dev for the parent
directory with st_dev of the child.  This is much simpler than parsing
/proc/mounts and will work for bind mounts as well as union mounts.

I think there's no question that union mounts might break apps (POSIX
or not).  But I think there's hope that they are few and can easily be
fixed.
