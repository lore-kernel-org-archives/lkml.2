Again, I still have no idea what you are trying to conjour up.  The
passthrough for STGT compatibility with TCM_Loop via SG_IO and BSG has
already been merged by Tomo-san into tgt.git.  Futhermore, we are using
the same TCM_Loop high level multi-fabric WWPN emulation together with
new (and old) QEMU HBA emulation into KVM guest using SG_IO and BSG as
well.

Seriously, arguing over the use of people's language from weeks ago once
the decision has already been made to move forward is really of little
value at this point.

Actually, that is incorrect.  Your project uses a centralized
development model, which has it's obvious limitiations in terms of
speed, flexability, and community scale.  But really, don't take my word
for it, you can hear it for yourself directly from the horse's mouth
here:

I also very strongly suggest you find a transcript of this talk so you
can really understand what Linus means here wrt to a distributed
development workflow.

Please don't turn this into a kernel.org vs. SF.net thing..  There are
plenty of places that offer free git hosting (see github)

Well, amougst the biggest advantages is actually having a sane ConfigFS
interface that can represent the parent / child relationship between
data structures across multiple LKMs.  Not only does this give us a
proper representation of TCM and fabric data structures that can be
accesses directly by an advanced user in /sys/kernel/config/target/, it
also provides an ideal foundation to build 1) a userspace library in
intrepted languages and 2) create high level applications using said
userspace libraries that allow compatiblity to be contained in the lib
below.

But wrt to actual kernel code (because this is a kernel list), the
shortlog for the RFC posting below nicely sums up what TCM v4 is
bringing to the table:

I think a proper kernel subsystem maintainer workflow has to do alot
more to do these days than just sending patches over email, than it did
say 10 years ago.  Like it or not, git is the language of the mainline
kernel development process, and trying to imagine a *new* kernel
subsystem maintainer (besides say, someone like akpm) not using git is
quite a stretch of the imagination at this point.
