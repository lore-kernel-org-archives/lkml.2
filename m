This comparision will also might break some logic in select_queue() where
we wait for a queue/group to get busy even if queue's time slice has
expired.

                        cfqq = NULL;

*************************************************************************

With this change, now above condition will never be true as
cfq_should_idle() will always return false as slice has already expired.
And that will affect group loosing its fair share.

So I guess we can define new functions to check more conditions instead of
putting it in cfq_should_idle()
