So it would seem.  Does Linux need to, though?

My aim was to avoid the need to create new stat syscalls in the future by
making it possible to increment the version number you're asking for.

glibc, on the other hand, only supports 32-bits for these.

My thought was that I could add extension fields to provide access to the
remote username/UID/GID values as well as the local UID/GID (since the latter
are used by the permission checking routines in the local VFS).

I wonder how best to represent 128-bit numbers.

	unsigned long long long

gives:

	include/linux/stat.h:151: error: 'long long long' is too long for GCC

so perhaps something like:

	struct xstat_u128 { unsigned long long lsw, msw; };

however, I suspect the kernel will require a bit of reengineering to handle a
pgoff_t and loff_t of 128-bits.

That's a separate problem.  That can be implemented now by overriding getattr
on blockdev files.  You could also set st_blocks and st_blksize to indicate
parameters of the blockdev - though that may upset df, I suppose.

They are a different sort of field (metametadata, I suppose).  But I can add
that on if you'd prefer.

Or comments could be used for that.

XSTAT_QUERY_LEGACY_STAT is XSTAT_QUERY__ORDINARY_SET.  Is "legacy" an
appropriate appellation, though?  They're the set most people expect to see
and want to use.

Passing -1 (or ULONGLONG_MAX) to get everything would be reasonable.

This should probably be an internal kernel constant.
