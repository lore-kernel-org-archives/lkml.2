It's more than that.  It's about the future maintainability of the
target kernel code.  Doing this reset to push the entire iSCSI login
into userspace for drivers/target/iscsi/ is technically the wrong
direction.   We already have a userspace target, and going down this
direction (again) for iscsi-target is not making forward progress.

I am not saying that everything has to be in the kernel.  I am saying
that the main iSCSI login state machines that *do* *not* effect
authentication payloads of the iSCSI login process need to be in kernel
for a kernel-level iscsi-target stack in order to properly support the
real-time management of the /sys/kernel/config/target/iscsi/ control
plane.

Being able to support the proper shutdown of all outstanding I/O across
N:M mapped iSCSI network portals <-> iSCSI TargetName
+TargetPortalGroupTag endpoints is already not trivial, and wanting to
move existing iscsi_target_login_thread() logic to (multi-threaded..?)
userspace where we now have to sychronize with everything going on in
the kernel is where there is a serious technical problem with what you
are suggesting that is now required for an initial iscsi-target merge.

That said, I am still open to a compromise of providing a method to
allow all iSCSI login CSG=0 state PDUs containing authentication
payloads sent/received into userspace.  However, this must be:

*) Enabled on individual /sys/kernel/config/target/iscsi/$IQN/$TPGT/
endpoint basis.  We need this to support independent userspace daemons
seperately of the authentication disabled mode that does not require any
userspace interaction.  This is important for the large scale
boot1.kernel.org public iscsi-target case (warthog9 CC'ed), where CSG=0
is being skipped all-together.

*) The main iSCSI login state machines stay in the kernel, and
individual successful login attempts with outstanding nexus I/O for
reinstatement events say in the kernel to avoid unwanted and unnecessary
sychronization complexity of a split kernel/user model across the entire
stack.

These two points are non negotiable for me, and are required for us
being able to properly support the required default iscsi-target kernel
feature set with target-core.  But more than that, its also about being
able to provide the python object library (rtslib) to drive the kernel
control plane.  This is what application developers and integrators
really want, and breaking the consistency of the object library for non
standard auth methods that do not even exist atm is where we are running
into disagreement.

We need to be able to support the user community with a proper library
moving forward to mask future underlying kernel control plane changes.
How iscsi-target currently works with rtslib is far superior in terms of
fuctionality and maintainability to any Linux/iSCSI target library have
exposed to application level devels thus far.  The non-standard auth
cases need to be able to work properly from both aspects, and the entire
iSCSI login state machine to userspace only IMHO complicates the
process.
