Sorry for not reporting earlier, but I didn't have time to do real
benchmarks, just a quick test on ARM926EJ-S using barebox,
and found in the new version decompression is slower:
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/barebox/2012-July/008268.html

BTW, do you have userspace code matching the old and new
lzo versions?  It would be easier to benchmark.

Unfortunately I cannot claim high confidence in my benchmark results
due to missing time to do it properly, it would be useful if
someone else could do some benchmarks on ARM before merging this.
