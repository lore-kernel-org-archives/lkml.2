While I was about to grab acp I've noticed seekwatcher with made my day :)

seekwatcher run of tar cf to eliminate writes (all done on 3.2.7):
1) btrfs: http://dozzie.jarowit.net/~dozzie/luczajac/tar_btrfs.png
2) ext4: http://dozzie.jarowit.net/~dozzie/luczajac/tar_ext4.png
3) both merged: http://dozzie.jarowit.net/~dozzie/luczajac/tar_btrfs_ext4.png

I will send acp results soon.
