Suggestions on recovering from an overflow here?

The salient possibilities are:

1. Do nothing, as was the case before this patch.
This leads to undefined behavior, but typically, a wrap happens.  This
leads to use-after-free bugs.

2. Detect the overflow before it happens, don't increment the counter,
issue a warning but no BUG.
This could also lead to some "undefined" behavior in subsystems.  I
can't imagine many users of kref have considered the situation of
kref_get essentially being a no-op, which is what would happen in this
situation.

3. Detect the overflow before it happens, don't increment the counter,
issue a BUG.
This is what the proposed patch does.  Suggestions for recovering
gracefully from this overflow are welcome.
