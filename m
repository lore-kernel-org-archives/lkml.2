Yes I've seen this. after I sent the patch. Hence the RFC tag

Yes I caught that with farther testing. A stupid mistake. Again RFC

Why? 

The all kref_ abstraction comes to a simple atomic_inc/dec.
Which is in theory a more lite wait operation then xchg, no memory
bus locking, and in practice is the same. (Except on massively
parallel machines which it is)

The last time I submitted a patch with xchg I got clobbered on the head
so strong that I ran away from it as-fast-as-I-could.

For objects life cycle the kref_get/put pattern is a much simpler
more common and understood style in the Kernel, if just for that sake.

I don't see why it needs to be "avoided".

Yes you are right.

The reason I need a timeout, is because: Calling from Kernel to
user-mode gives me the creeps. I don't trust user-mode programs,
specially when in final Control by a Distribution. Bugs can happen
and deadlocks are a possibility. An operation that should take 
1/2 second and could max to at most 1.5 seconds, I can say in
confidence that after 15 seconds, a dmesg and a clean error recovery
is better. I don't want any chance of D stating IO operations.
(My code is in the IO path, either fsync or write-back. There is not
 always a killable target)

The code path I have is easily recoverable, and if not for the scary
message in dmesg the user will not notice.

So in short it is so I can sleep at night.

Again, Personally I like xchg, but not here, not for an object
life-time management. Two threads share a structure, that needs
to go when the last one ends. That's a kref_ abstraction. Kref,
inside, could be implemented with xchg(), But that's not for me to
decide, I should use good abstractions when they exist and do the
job (well). No?

Thanks Oleg, yes I'll rebase, Is there an mm git tree? I could not
find it on git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/ . mean while I'll use a
random linux-next/master point. Which should do the job.

Thanks
