I can vouch that it makes the list_debug.c:53 warnings go away: they
used to come in half an hour, but I've run on two machines for 10
hours so far without seeing any.

And I've not yet seen a cfq-iosched.c:2585 with that patch in; but
those were more elusive - we'll have to run until tomorrow night
before concluding that it makes those go away too.

Or if you understand the connection between these, and would prefer
to assume that it fixes them both, and want me to try another patch
instead (I assume the one I'm running with is a workaround to narrow
down the issue, rather than an intended fix?), let me know and I'll
switch over.
