Oops.  I forgot to update JBD2_TAG_SIZE64.

I have a question, though -- it looks as though the code that handles reading
and writing tags from raw disk blocks calls journal_tag_bytes() to determine
the tag size, and manually increments a pointer "tagp" to step through the
block.  This construction seems to be be sufficient to deal with possible
differences between sizeof(journal_block_tag_t) and the on-disk tag size, and
both increases over the 32bit tag size are gated on INCOMPAT_64BIT and
INCOMPAT_CSUM_V2.

Had I defined JBD2_TAG_SIZE64 with offsetof() as Ted did above, I think that
journal_tag_bytes() would return the correct on-disk tag size, which should fix
the scenario Ted outlined above.  The tag checksum set/verify functions would
also need to be taught where t_checksum is (in the space occupied by
t_blocknr_high) on a 32bit journal.  Could those two suggestions fix the
problem without causing us to discard half the checksum bits?



Well, not quite -- the calculation of tags per block in journal.c below the
comment "journal descriptor can store up to n blocks -bzzz" probably ought to
be using journal_tag_bytes(), not sizeof(journal_block_tag_t) to figure out how
many tags can be crammed into a disk block, since right now I think it
underreports the number of tags per block on a 32bit journal.
journal_tag_disk_size() is a more descriptive name for journal_tag_bytes().

As for putting half the checksum into the upper 16 bits of the flags field --
is journal space at such a premium that we need to overload the field and
reduce the strength of the checksum?  Enabling journal checksums on a 4k block
filesystem causes tags_per_block to decrease from 512 to 341 on a 32bit journal
and from 341 to 256 on a 64bit journal.  Do transactions typically have that
many blocks?  I didn't think most transactions had 1-2MB of dirty data.
