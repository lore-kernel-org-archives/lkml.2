At least for SCSI sd driver, the PM request is always queued at the head.

scsi_execute()
  blk_execute_rq(req->q, NULL, req, 1);

"1" means the request will be inserted at the head.

blk_execute_rq_nowait()
   spin_lock_irq(q->queue_lock);
   __elv_add_request(q, rq, where);
   __blk_run_queue(q)
   spin_unlock_irq(q->queue_lock);

So the request is inserted at the head and executed immediatly.

I am travelling through June 10.
I'll investigate these when I'm back.

Thanks,
