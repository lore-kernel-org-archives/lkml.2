I think you know the answer to that.  ;-)  Thanks for catching this.

The idea behind the patch is to optimize the idling such that we don't
wait needlessly for more sync-noidle I/O when it likely isn't coming.
As mentioned in the patch description, it aims to bring the sync-noidle
workload, which is treated like a single cfqq, more in-line with the
handling of a single cfqq.

I'm not sure I follow 100%.  Are you saying we should disable idling for
the sync-noidle workload if the think time is too long?  That sounds
reasonable.

Again, looking for clarification on this point.

Right, thanks for pointing this out.  Do we have a test case that
exposes this issue?  We really need to start a regression test suite for
CFQ.  Also, I had promised to run some numbers for you with cgroups
enabled and I didn't.  I'll get that data before the next posting.

Thanks for the review, Vivek!
