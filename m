I suspect nlmclnt_lookup_host() is to blame. It appears to be the _only_
thing in the kernel that actually sets this 'srcaddr' field, and it sets
it to

const struct sockaddr source = {
	.sa_family      = AF_UNSPEC,
};

You triggered the bug by removing the line

	transport->srcaddr.ss_family = family;

from xs_create_sock().
