The problem is the locking order, we can't hold page lock then start the
journal lock. Kjournald will need to hold the journal lock first, then
commit, commit may need to callback writepages, which need to hold the
page lock.


I looked at ext3, in that case, ext3 even don't have ext3_page_mkwrite()
to do the stable page yet. It requires some block reservation/delayed
allocation for filling holes in mmaped IO case. Jan tried that before I
don't think the proposal get far.


Now looking back ext4_page_mkwrite(), it calls write_begin(), as long as
we do wait in write_begin() things would be fine, right? It seems
Darrick already did that wait per Dave Chinner's suggestion when grab
the page and lock that page. But still a puzzle to me why that's not
sufficient.
