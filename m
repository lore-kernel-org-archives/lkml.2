In the case of FITRIM, you're right: the performance impact
probably doesn't matter much for a 4am cronjob.

But a lot of people currently (at least) prefer to run it manually,
and they don't want it to take forever.

Though that's still not the primary worry:  each TRIM seems to trigger
a flash erase cycle (or cycles) on the most common SSDs on the market,
including anything Indilinx-based and as far as I can tell also for
anything SandForce based.  That's probably 70% of the SSDs out there today.

And I'm very concerned about premature wear -- MLC is only for 10000 cycles (avg).

Also, the current one-range-at-a-time interface is just not correct
for the majority of devices out there:  they are SATA, not some obscure
enterprise-only one-range-at-a-time thing.  We need an implementation
that reflects real-life for uses other than data centres.

If nobody else does it, I'll probably implement it correctly this winter.
But it would really be better for a real filesystem/DM person to do it.

Thanks for hanging in there this far, though!

Cheers
