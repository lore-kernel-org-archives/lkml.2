I just took a look at the Red Hat bugzilla entry mentioned above.  It 
seems to be quite different from the issue addressed by the patch I 
just posted -- a crash with invalid memory access rather than a lockdep 
violation and hang of the khubd thread.

It's also notable that the stack dump in the bugzilla report doesn't 
contain any functions in the USB subsystem.  Of course this doesn't 
prove anything, but it is suggestive.

Evidently the sdev argument to scsi_prep_state_check() was NULL.  This
looks like the problem that cropped up before, where q->queuedata was
getting set to NULL while the queue was still in use.  I can't imagine
how anything in usb-storage could have caused that.
