Subject: [PATCH v9 34/34] vfs: add a sliding backoff delay between ESTALE retries

...with a hard, arbitrary cap on the amount of time that it will sleep
between tries. If we have a case where we're doing a lot of retries on
an ESTALE, then this should help keep us from hammering the fs as badly.

With this change, retry_estale has probably outgrown being an inline.
Make the check for ESTALE error an inline, and turn the rest of the
actual handling into a regular function.
