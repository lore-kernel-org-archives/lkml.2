Yes, and I accepted that patch.  I was referring to your complaints of
printk's such as this:

#ifdef EXT4FS_DEBUG
			WARN_ON(ret <= 0);
			printk(KERN_ERR "%s: ext4_ext_map_blocks "
				    "returned error inode#%lu, block=%u, "
				    "max_blocks=%u", __func__,
				    inode->i_ino, map.m_lblk, max_blocks);
#endif

... and in that case, even if I was going to fix it, I wouldn't be
fixing it via pr_err().  I'd be fixing using ext4_msg().  Why?
Because then the message would include the block device and not just
the EXT4-fs prefix.

Changing to pr_err() is pointless, because it doesn't do anything
functional.  You *have* to have an interface like ext4_msg(sb, ...) if
you're going to send a semi-structured notification, or include
relevant information about which ext4 file system was responsible for
issuing the warning.

If you're going to change huge numbers of lines of code, you might as
well do it in a way that significantly improves things.  The change to
pr_foo() is just syntactic sugar, and that's a whitespace-level change
in my book.  Adding a struct super * or or a struct block device *,
which gets passed to the notification functions?  That's ***far***
more interesting.
