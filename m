AFAICT any type of non TYPE_DISK struct scsi_device passthrough is going
to currently require virtio-scsi in order to work.

The logic that comes with target_core_fabric_configfs.c and the native
target control plane gives a host-side (tcm_vhost) fabric driver generic
explict/implict ALUA multipath support by default.

I think there are some interesting possibilities for paravirtualized
ALUA multipath..  8-)

Ouch, virtio-blk lacks multi-lun per pci slot support..?

MSFT cluster guests that require SPC-3 PR support can run today with
tcm_loop LLD SCSI LUNs + SG_IO/BSG + right megasas QEMU HBA emulation,
but I do agree this would be better served by virtio-scsi for guests
that require SPC-3 PR support or passthrough.
