Yes, sounds reasonable.  I guess we'd have to verify all the inode checksums
before changing the UUID, change the UUID, and then set new checksums.  If the
pre-verification step fails, demand e2fsck and don't write anything.

Ok, I'll pull that into my tree.

Agreed.  I discovered another problem is that there seem to be a number of
places where e2fsck loads only the first 128 bytes out of an inode, checks it,
and then writes out a "corrected" 128 byte inode.  Obviously e2fsck needs to be
changed to read in the full inode size (whatever that is) and write out the
same amount, though this will probably result in a lot of e2fsck code churn.

I added the ability for e2fsck to zero out the checksum if it finds a Linux
ext* fs and the checksum feature disabled.

Mingming was also wondering if we ought to save some rocompat bits and combine
all the current checksumming proposals (extent tree, bitmaps) under one
rocompat bit?  Sounds like a decent idea to me.

By the way, I've been uploading my notes about on-disk layout to the wiki:
https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout

(Not sure if it's 100% clueful, but there we go.)
