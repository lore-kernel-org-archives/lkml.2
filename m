Allow 3rd party multipath drivers to programatically detach a scsi_dh
using the scsi_dh_detach() interface.  This is as improvement over
requiring them to write 'detach' to /sys/block/sdX/queue/dh_state

End result is both Linux and 3rd party multipath drivers can coexist
without compromising Linux's default handling of multipath LUNs.

Linux has suffered from races associated with attaching a scsi_dh to a
device too late (after an HBA driver has started the SCSI device scan).
Attaching a scsi_dh too late results in default sense handling that does
not silently fail IO to passive paths, which creates excessive delays
and IO errors during normal boot on a system with hundreds of LUNs.

To fix this the appropriate scsi_dh must be attached before the HBA
driver(s) are even loaded.  But some scsi_dh are known to conflict with
3rd party multipath drivers (e.g. both scsi_dh_alua and scsi_dh_emc
conflict with EMC PowerPath).  This patch allows 3rd party drivers to
resolve the conflict by detaching an attached scsi_dh.
