Thanks for your rapid replies.

x86_64 kernel booted with "mem=700M cgroup_disable=memory" (latter to
rule out any memcg effects), swap was 1.5G, ext2 block size was 1024,

CONFIG_EXT4_FS=y
CONFIG_EXT4_USE_FOR_EXT23=y
CONFIG_EXT4_FS_XATTR=y
CONFIG_EXT4_FS_POSIX_ACL=y
# CONFIG_EXT4_FS_SECURITY is not set
# CONFIG_EXT4_DEBUG is not set

fsx options as below, no fallocation or holepunching:

fsx foo -q -c 100 -l 100000000 &
while :
do	# memory hog mmaps and touches each page of 800MB private area
	swapout 800
done

You might well wonder about the provenance of my fsx, and I'm not
certain where it came from originally (perhaps akpm's toolbox about
nine years ago).  So I got an xfstests.git tree

built the latest version of fsx there, and ran the script with that,
on 3.2-rc2+ kernel pulled yesterday.

This time I used a disk partition, to rule out any loop or tmpfs
effects; but sized the partition to 460800 blocks to match what
I'd been using with loop and tmpfs (after growing impatient when
the first run on the whole 1.5G partition ran for half an hour -
but in retrospect perhaps it was about to blow when I stopped it).

It ran for 28 minutes before fsx failed with
