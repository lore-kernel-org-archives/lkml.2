It's been there for a long time, at least since the start of
the git history, and it's very likely correct this way.

The one in the open function was moved there when the
BKL was moved out from vfs_open(), while the use in ioctl is
implicit by never having been converted to unlocked_ioctl.

I don't see anything that really needs BKL protection in
sg_open, so that can probably just be killed. For sg_ioctl,
at least the blk_trace_* and scsi_ioctl stuff is currently
called with BKL held everywhere else (not in st_ioctl though)
and may still need that.

Ok. I've also checked st.c again and noticed that it
doesn't use use the BKL in ioctl() but only in open(),
which is very unlikely to race against anything in sg.c
or the block subsystem.
