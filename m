Agreed, but I'm willing to live with a solution that addresses most of
these situations, even if we can't fix them all. If retrying
indefinitely may be a problem for other filesystems then we can't
just ignore that...

I'm fairly certainly that looping indefinitely would be just fine for
NFS. My main concern is those FUSE fs' that Miklos alluded to when he
reviewed your earlier set.

He said that some can return ESTALE indefinitely, and they don't
necessarily respect signals. If limiting the number of retries helps
prevent problems with those, then that's still better than the current
situation.
