Unless you are specifically using e2defrag (or write code which explicitly calls this ext4-specific ioctl), the code path in question wouldn't even be entered, and I see nothing in this stack trace to indicate it was caused by this change.

Since this bug is not deterministically reproducible bisecting turned out
harder then anticipated. I get as far as:
bad d2dd328b7f7bc6cebe167648289337755944ad2a
good a094c0afc3515aaf962dd0793f3b23fe67e6b192
(Take even this result with a grain of salt, because a single wrong "git
bisect good" will lead to wrong results)

After that git bisect quickly goes to lala land.
