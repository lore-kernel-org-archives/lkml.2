So the guarantee that it doesn't look at stale data after the sync on a
cache coherent machine means ordering the dma write to physical memory
with the subsequent cpu read ... no memory barrier can actually do that.
Usually this is done externally, by making sure the memory change is
visible before sending the irq that tells the driver it is there ... on
some numa systems, this can be a problem (hence the mmiowb/relaxed read
thing).

I still don't see why ... I don't see how you'd ever get a read of the
area speculated before the event that tells the driver its OK to read
the memory.  In theory, I agree that it looks logical to require the
read never be speculated before the sync ... but in practice, I don't
see there ever being a problem with this since the sync isn't the event
that says the memory is safe to read.
