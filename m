Exactly! It really surprise me that you call it a defect, moreover the
name you've chosen for the flag is IMO wrong. With security hole like
this you really want give user very strong feeling that he is NOT supposed
to use it if he does not know what he is doing. Maybe something like
FALLOC_FL_EXPOSE_USER_DATA because that is what it does.

But it is not in your test case. Does it mean that your test case is

Yes, please do. I do not think that in this case simply doing 'time
dd' is enough. We need to know what is happening inside the kernel to see
what is causing the slowdown. It may very well be that we might be able
to fix it, rather than introduce crazy security hole to bypass the
problem.

No, you're not getting the point. In kernel (or fs) we are supposed to
prevent from security problems as much as possible and it is
indisputably the job of file systems to prevent reading data which are
NOT in the file system and might have belonged to the other user. If you
want to do this, just use raw device.

Limiting this by proper capabilities is so not enough from tons of
reasons. Application have bugs, which may very well cause the stale data
to be exported directly to the user of the application which might not
even have root capabilities. Consider buggy database returning stale
data (possibly deleted secret informations) from the on user to
another, it _is_ possible and things like that _will_ happen with
this "feature", what is even worse that in this case the application
writers do actually use the fallocate flag right.

Moreover, a lot of application are getting rid of the root capabilities
once they are executed and initialized from the obvious reason. Consider
the case where the application is doing fallocate-expose-stale-data
before betting rid of the root cap, then after it gets rid of the root
cap, the "regular user" have access to the other users old data.

And it might not even be the case of buggy application, consider very
simple case where root fallocate-expose-stale-data a file and did not
set read permission right, then *any* user can read other users data.
This will definitely happen as this kind of errors happens all the time.

And also you're assuming that the application developer or root
administrator know exactly what the problem is and can see all the
corner cases as are the few I've described above, that's not the case,
they will get it wrong in some cases especially when it will be promoted
as performance boost.

I do not like this "feature" at all, what about rather fixing the
problem ? Xfs does not seem to have this issue, at least not as
noticeable, so it is definitely possible.

Thanks!
