I think the problem is that __scsi_remove_device will now wait for
commands to get dequeued and run, before proceeding but we do not take a
device off the starved list until scsi_device_dev_release_usercontext is
run, or maybe thinking about it another way scsi_kill_request does not
remove sdevs from the starved list if the device is being removed.

So lets say we hit the not_ready path in scsi_request_fn and put the
sdev on the starved list. Then we remove the device. We could end up
putting the device in SDEV_DEL, and then calling scsi_request_fn via
blk_cleanup_queue's drain queue call. scsi_request_fn would hit the
scsi_device_online check and fail the IO, but we never took the sdev off
the starved list from what I can tell.

Now, there is no IO in the queue and so __scsi_remove_device continues.
It then calls scsi_device_dev_release_usercontext at the same time some
other thread is calling scsi_run_queue. We then race. scsi_run_queue
splices the starved list with the sdev we are trying to remove and
deletes the list entry from the list and drops the host lock. But then
scsi_device_dev_release_usercontext grabs the host lock and ends up
running the entire function and freeing the queue. Then scsi_run_queue
tries to access the sdev and queue so it can grab the queue lock that
was just freed and kablewy.
