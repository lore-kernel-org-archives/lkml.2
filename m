I think in btrfs you need a raid1/5 multi-device configuration for this
to work. If you use a single device then it is just like ext4.

BTW: you could use DM or MD and it will guard your DIF by coping the
data before IO.

I suggest we should talk about this issue in upcoming LSF, because it does
not only affects DIF but any checksum subsystem. And it could enhance Linux
raid performance.
