I can't explain this ... it's the bit I think is bogus.  If we need
refcounted queues, it's impossible to satisfy and if we don't, why do we
have refcounts?

The root cause of this is allowing drivers to specify locks.  If we
really want to continue doing this, we should have a lock release
function which is called as part of the queue refcounting model where
the final lock free can be done.  That's a big amount of work if you
look at all the block drivers which use their own locks.
