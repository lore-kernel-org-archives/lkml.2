No. Because the process can receive a reply to the write() syscall that
indicates that the data is safe, but the EKEYEXPIRED error will cause
the data to be lost when the client tries to actually commit the data to
disk.

Which is just wrong: the general intention of kerberos security is to
ensure that the _user_ has ACKed an operation. Renewing tickets without
user input would circumvent that intention. If you need to have the job
run overnight, then ask for a longer lifetime for your ticket.

Notify the kernel that a ticket is about to expire so that the kernel
can decide to block the process on the next NFS-related syscall.
