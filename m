Yes, I understand that (we have no highmem on parisc, so kmap is a nop).
The problem (at least as I see it) is that once something within the
kernel (well, OK, mostly within drivers) touches a user page via its
kernel mapping, the flush often gets forgotten (mainly because it always
works on x86). What I was thinking about is that every time the kernel
touches a user space page, it has to be within a kmap/kunmap pair
(because the page might be highmem) ... so it's possible to make
kmap/kunmap do the flushing for this case so the driver writer can't
ever forget it.

I think the problem case is only really touching scatter/gather elements
outside of the DMA API (i.e. the driver pio case), so this may be
overkill.  Russell also pointed out that a lot of the PIO iterators do
excessive kmap_atomic/kunmap_atomic on the same page, so adding a flush
could damage performance to the point where the flash root devices on
arm might not work.  Plus the pio iterators already contain the
appropriate flush, so perhaps just using them in every case fixes the
problem.

Yes, unfortunately, we have seen this quite a bit; mainly to get large
buffers.  Its not just confined to drivers:  xfs used to fail on both
arm and parisc because it used a vmalloc region for its log buffer which
it then had to do I/O on.
