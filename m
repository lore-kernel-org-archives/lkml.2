No, ctime isn't the same as Windows "create time". Windows
"create time" semantics are that the timestamp is set to
current time on file creation, but afterwards anyone with
sufficient access can then modify it (!). Which is different
from the "birthtime" spec on *BSD, as they can't be modified.

Currently on *BSD we look for our special EA containing any
modified create times on a file, and return that as "create
time" if found, if not we return the st_birthtime from the
stat struct. That works well enough for systems where you
don't want to allow birthtime to be changed. Having said
that I'm not sure how they cope with doing restores to
a filesystem where you would need to set st_birthtime :-).

Jeremy.
