I guess I was assuming that, on receiving a FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, a
filesystem that was TRIM-aware would pass that information down to the
block device that it's mounted on.  I strongly feel that we shouldn't
have two interfaces to do essentially the same thing.

I guess I'm saying that you're going to have to learn about TRIM :-)
