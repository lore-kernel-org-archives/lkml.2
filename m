I want to drop EXT4_FS from that default line.  Then we only need it in the
case where EXT4_USE_FOR_EXT23=y hasn't taken the place of EXT3_FS=y.

<shrug> Has anyone actually done that?

Heh, even *I* haven't done that.

Yes.  I'd actually considered simply calling should_snapshot() on the first
bio_vec page and passing that information through, but thought I should play it
safe for the first revision.

However, a bio targets a single block device, so this seems like a safe
optimization.
