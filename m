As fun as it is for the others monitoring these lists to see redhat.com
vs suse.de banter I think framing this discussion like you (and Mikulas)
continue to do is a complete distraction.

I tried to elevate (and defuse) the discussion yesterday.  But simply

and anyone else who has something to contribute that moves us toward a
real fix for discards.
