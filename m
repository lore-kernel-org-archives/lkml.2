Ok, but please understand that this is a technical list where we discuss
specifics of kernel code, and produce and review patches to reach a
desired goal.

One of the reason that TCM/LIO has been selected over SCST is because
our patch workflow over the recent yeras demonstrates exactly this point
the mainline folks who are following along.  For the new persistent
reservations and ALUA multipath features that have been developed in
recent times, the code was added feature bit by feature bit in a
reviewablle manner, with each patch series going to linux-scsi for
comments.  This allowed the code to benefit in a number of cases where
different people (including Tomo-san, mnc, and others) noticed something
strange in their own testing, and in each case we where able to get the
item resolved. The scoreboard for these features is on the wiki here:

http://linux-iscsi.org/index.php/Persistent_Reservations
http://linux-iscsi.org/index.php/ALUA

In terms of some feature list about who supports what for the mainline
discussion, this is quite pointless at this point.  The best way for
mainline people to know what your stack supports is to actually add
support for said feature in reviewable and digestable pieces that are
presented in much a manner that they are accessable to a larger
audicence.  Just developing code some-where else and posting the entire
thing means the code in question does not benefit by public review
during the development phase.

We have some people happly using ESX with LUN_RESET emulation with CDB
level emulation with TCM/FILEIO , TCM/IBLOCK and with TCM/pSCSI in
passthrough mode.

Yes, it needs to fall back to LUN_RESET, or reset the iSCSI I_T nexus.
I am happy to add proper TASK_ABORT support into TCM v4 at some point
down the line.  However if you can demonstrate that this is a real issue
to me for your particular setup/version of ESX with LUNs reporting SPC-2
or SPC-3 support, I would be happy to consider bumping this up the
priority list.

TCM/LIO v3 has been validated for the highest level of Vsphere 4
compliance (eg: above ESX which only uses SPC-2) with >= SPC-3
compatiable Persistent Reservations and ALUA multipath.

http://linux-iscsi.org/index.php/Ecosystem

The vendors on this list including, but not limited to QNAP, Data
Robotics, and Netgear have all received independent SPC-3 SCSI LUN
verification with VMware using TCM/LIO v3.x directly over the last 12
months.  Which means that here in North America, you can walk into just
about any major electronic store that carries these products, and
purchase TCM/LIO v3.x in shrinkwrap form from multiple vendors on
multiple hardware platforms. In some cases, these products using a
custom set of userspace /sys/kernel/config/target/ scripts code (of
varing degrees of quality) with a propritary web-interface (also of
varing degrees of quality) on top.

Best,
