Sorry, but this is a waste of your time, my time, and that of
everybody else in this thread.

I will ignore any subsequent proposals from you unless they start with
a coherent description of an actual problem.  Something that has
impact on userspace, or significant impact on kernel development.

If there is a bug I don't see in your description above, than please
explain how it affects userspace.  If the code or comments are cryptic
and can be simplified or clarified, please explain.
