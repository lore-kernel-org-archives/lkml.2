>   - Acquire dcache_lock around call to __d_path() in cr_fill_name()
>   - Force end-of-string in cr_read_string() (fix possible DoS)
>   - Introduce cr_write_buffer(), cr_read_buffer() and cr_read_buf_type()
> 
> [2008-Nov-10] v9:
>   - Support multiple processes c/r
>   - Extend checkpoint header with archtiecture dependent header 
>   - Misc bug fixes (see individual changelogs)
>   - Rebase to v2.6.28-rc3.
> 
> [2008-Oct-29] v8:
>   - Support "external" checkpoint
>   - Include Dave Hansen's 'deny-checkpoint' patch
>   - Split docs in Documentation/checkpoint/..., and improve contents
> 
> [2008-Oct-17] v7:
>   - Fix save/restore state of FPU
>   - Fix argument given to kunmap_atomic() in memory dump/restore
> 
> [2008-Oct-07] v6:
>   - Balance all calls to cr_hbuf_get() with matching cr_hbuf_put()
>     (even though it's not really needed)
>   - Add assumptions and what's-missing to documentation
>   - Misc fixes and cleanups
> 
> [2008-Sep-11] v5:
>   - Config is now 'def_bool n' by default
>   - Improve memory dump/restore code (following Dave Hansen's comments)
>   - Change dump format (and code) to allow chunks of <vaddrs, pages>
>     instead of one long list of each
>   - Fix use of follow_page() to avoid faulting in non-present pages
>   - Memory restore now maps user pages explicitly to copy data into them,
>     instead of reading directly to user space; got rid of mprotect_fixup()
>   - Remove preempt_disable() when restoring debug registers
>   - Rename headers files s/ckpt/checkpoint/
>   - Fix misc bugs in files dump/restore
>   - Fixes and cleanups on some error paths
>   - Fix misc coding style
> 
> [2008-Sep-09] v4:
>   - Various fixes and clean-ups
>   - Fix calculation of hash table size
>   - Fix header structure alignment
>   - Use stand list_... for cr_pgarr
> 
> [2008-Aug-29] v3:
>   - Various fixes and clean-ups
>   - Use standard hlist_... for hash table
>   - Better use of standard kmalloc/kfree
> 
> [2008-Aug-20] v2:
>   - Added Dump and restore of open files (regular and directories)
>   - Added basic handling of shared objects, and improve handling of
>     'parent tag' concept
>   - Added documentation
>   - Improved ABI, 64bit padding for image data
>   - Improved locking when saving/restoring memory
>   - Added UTS information to header (release, version, machine)
>   - Cleanup extraction of filename from a file pointer
>   - Refactor to allow easier reviewing
>   - Remove requirement for CAPS_SYS_ADMIN until we come up with a
>     security policy (this means that file restore may fail)
>   - Other cleanup and response to comments for v1
> 
> [2008-Jul-29] v1:
>   - Initial version: support a single task with address space of only
>     private anonymous or file-mapped VMAs; syscalls ignore pid/crid
>     argument and act on current process.
