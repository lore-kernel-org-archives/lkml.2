That's why I asked how to tell if barriers are actually hitting the
device in question.

No, this is the only machine where DM/MD is _not_ used.  On all other
machines we use MD software raid, this machine comes with an onboard
raid controller that does not work in JBOD mode so I weren't able to
use linux software raid.  This is XFS on top of Adaptec RAID card,
nothing in-between.

Also, as I mentioned in the previous email, remounting with nobarrier
makes no difference whatsoever.

(Another side note here - I discovered that unknown options are
silently ignored in "remount mode" while correctly rejected in
"plain mount" mode, -- it looks like a kernel bug actually, but
it's entirely different issue).

I know this.  I also found osyncisosync and osyncisdsync mount
options, and when I try to use the latter, kernel tells it's the
default and hence deprecated.  I don't need metadata updates, but
it _looks_ like the system is doing such updates (with barriers
or flushes?) anyway even when mounted with -o osyncisdsync it behaves
the same: very slow.

I also experimented with both O_SYNC|O_DIRECT: it is as slow as
without O_DIRECT, i.e. O_SYNC makes whole thing slow regardless
of other options.

I looked at the dmesg outputs, and there's no relevant differences
related to block devices or usage of barriers.  For XFS it always
mounts like this:

  SGI XFS with ACLs, security attributes, large block/inode numbers, no debug enabled
  SGI XFS Quota Management subsystem
  XFS mounting filesystem sda6

and for the device in question, it is always like

  Adaptec aacraid driver 1.1-5[2456]-ms
  aacraid 0000:03:01.0: PCI INT A -> GSI 24 (level, low) -> IRQ 24

There are tons of other differences, but that is to be expected (like
format of CPU topology printing which is changed between .27 and .32).

Thanks!
