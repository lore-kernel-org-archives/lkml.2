   RAID5    btrfs     10dd   +21.3%
   RAID5    btrfs      1dd   +14.3%
   RAID5      xfs    100dd   +32.8%
   RAID5      xfs     10dd   +21.5%
   RAID5      xfs      1dd   +25.2%
   RAID0    btrfs    100dd    -7.4%
   RAID0    btrfs     10dd    -0.2%
   RAID0    btrfs      1dd    -2.8%
   RAID0      xfs    100dd   +18.8%
   RAID0      xfs     10dd    +0.0%
   RAID0      xfs      1dd    +3.8%
    JBOD    btrfs    100dd    -0.0%
    JBOD    btrfs     10dd    +2.3%
    JBOD    btrfs      1dd    -0.1%
    JBOD      xfs    100dd    +8.3%
    JBOD      xfs     10dd    +4.1%
    JBOD      xfs      1dd    +0.1%
