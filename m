The patch did not work, although it did get pass the earlier condition
which I mentioned- but still Write Cache is not taken into account –
seems mode sensing in sd_read_cache_type() does not send proper
request to the device – or does not read in proper bytes for this(as
per hdparm command analysis):

And the impact of Enabling/Disabling Cache can be seen in:

Looking at corresponding code in ‘hdparm’ to fetch this: an ioctl with
command ‘ATA_OP_IDENTIFY’ is passed to the device using SG_IO
interface (function – get_identify_data()) – which receives the buffer
data and that is passed to identify the device specification.

00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

So, probably the kernel code for sensing the disk and reading to check
for the presence of the cache is not working for these USB HDD’s, I
have tried with a number of hard-disk’s(different manufactures –
with/without write cache) just to make sure that the observation is
correct.

The corresponding effect of enabling/disabling the write cache can be
seen on the write performance also - .

Please share your opinion on this.

Thanks & Regards,
