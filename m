Hi Boaz,

actually it seems to me that using sg_set_page is wrong, because it will
not copy the end marker from table->sgl to sg[].  If something chained
the sg[] scatterlist onto something else, sg_next's test for sg_is_last
would go beyond the table->nents-th item and access invalid memory.

Using chained sglists is on my to-do list, I expect that it would make a
nice performance improvement.  However, I was a bit confused as to
what's the plan there; there is hardly any user, and many arches still
do not define ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN.  Do you have any pointer to discussions
or LWN articles?

I would need to add support for the long sglists to virtio; this is not
a problem, but in the past Rusty complained that long sg-lists are not
well suited to virtio (which would like to add elements not just at the
beginning of a given sglist, but also at the end).  It seems to me that
virtio would prefer to work with a struct scatterlist ** rather than a
long sglist.

Paolo
