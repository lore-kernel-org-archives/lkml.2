That is basically how the runtime PM timer works, if you use it as I

When the queue is first created, the timer is started.

Whenever the timer expires, the code checks to see if any requests have 
been processed since the previous expiration.  If they have, the timer 
is restarted.  If they haven't, you suspend the device.
