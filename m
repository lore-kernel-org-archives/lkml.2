So, here's the deal:  You get this driver to a mergeable state, which
means all of the problems Christoph, others and I have outlined
completely fixed or well on the way to being in two months and I will
take it under the merge window exception for new drivers.  However, I
mean seriously cleaned up and shiny (and dumping tens of thousands of
lines of flue code and other oddities), not cleaned up for staging.
Further you're going to have to use standard methods to store and
retrieve data, not esoteric efi ones that rely on changes outside SCSI
(you aren't the first people to need to set a SAS address and other
things, so we have a request firmware like method for it).

If you can't make it in two months .. can you do it? I'll extend the
offer to the .40 which makes the cutoff around 5 months, if you need
extra time.

What I suggest is that you take about a month and a half to make all the
changes and then do a patch code drop on linux-scsi.  If you're less
sure about what you need to do, do one after three weeks and we'll redo
the assessment.
