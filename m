Note too that the gssd code distinguishes between an expired TGT and a
non-existent credcache. The latter will give you the error you desire
here. So one possibility is just to remove the credcache from /tmp in
this situation.

Another possibility might be a new option to rpc.gssd that allows the
user to select the error that it passes back to the kernel on an
expired ticket.
