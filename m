Hi OGAWA Hirofumi

Thanks a lot for looking at this and reply.

Ok.

As far as FAT is concerned, Sparse files would break the on-disk format?

I had a one-off use-case, where I had no free-space, which made me think along 
this line.

1. We have the GNU split tool for example, which I guess, many of us use to 
split larger files to be transfered via smaller thumb drives, for example. We 
do cat many files into one, afterwards. [For this usecase, one can simply dd 
with seek and skip and avoid split/cat completely, but we dont.]

2. It could be useful for multimedia editing softwares, that converts frames 
into video/animation and vice versa.

3. It could be useful for archiving solutions.

4. It would make it easier to implement simple databases. Even help avoid 
needing databases at times. For example, to delete a row, split before & after 
that row, and join leaving it.

So I thought this could be useful generally.

I was also thinking of facilities to add/remove bytes from/at any position in 
the file. As you said truncate any range, but one which can also increase the 
filesize, adding blocks even in between.

IMO It is kind of Chicken-and-egg problem, where applications will start using 
these, only, if it would be available.

Agreed.

Again, thanks for the comments.

Thanks
