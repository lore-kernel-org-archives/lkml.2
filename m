as a sysadmin, it's a _wonderful_ tool to have for any system that has 
people editing/saving files on directly.

that depends on the site policy.

sometimes it is better to loose snapshots than to run out of disk space 
and halt the system, sometimes you would rather halt the system.

the policy of what happens when you run out of space should not be a 
kernel decision, the desired behavior varies far too much.

this includes being able to say things like "I want to always have 10% of 
my disk allocated to snapshots, but if there's more free space, go ahead 
and use it, but always keep at least 10% of the disk free so that you 
don't have to halt new writes while you clear space"

or

"if you run out of space, try and keep the oldest snapshot and the newest 
snapshot, delete other snapshots in between before touching either of 
these"

the worst case when you re-write a file is that it will take the full 
amount of space that the file currently takes (as if you wrote a new copy 
of the file and some process had a filehandle open on the old copy, 
preventing the space from being reclaimed, so it's far from being a new 
problem)

see the note above about the need to be able to remove snapshots when you 
are out of space.

since snapshots tend to be small compared to the filesystems they protect 
(not in all cases, but if you are covering the entire system with one 
snapshot that would be the way to bet), having the ability to put the 
snapshot metadata off on a smaller/faster disk would be helpful.

having the ability to snapshot just specific files/directories would be a 
killer feature IMHO
