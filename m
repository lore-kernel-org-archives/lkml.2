OK, I can certainly agree with that logic..

Well, this issue still:

Can we finess this detail by making the "set an ACL and make needed changes to
the mode bits" part of the VFS's responsibility as part of whatever syscall/
ioctl handling?  After all, the LSM doesn't get involved in the handling of
chmod() other than to say "yes/no this chmod can be issued" -  for instance,
the clearing of setUID/setGID bits when a file is written is done by each
individual filesystem. So there's certianly precident for doing the permission
tweaking in the VFS code. Then we can limit the LSM part to *applying* an
already existing ACL to permission checking.

Or should I go get some more caffeine? ;)
