Yep, that's why the current solution is somewhat middle of the road...

I don't think we have those stats, though it could/should be pulled from
the ksoftirqX threads. We could have some metric, ala

        dest_cpu = get_group_completion_cpu(rq->cpu);
        if (ksoftirqd_of(dest_cpu) >= 90% busy)
                dest_cpu = rq->cpu;

to send things completely local to the submitter of the IO, IFF the
current CPU is close to running at full tilt.
