Why wouldn't it be allowed to change the system call number?

And try answering that question in a way that doesn't apply to syscall
argument values too.

No it's not fine, because it's inconsistent and arbitrary.

It still gives normal ptracers the ability to bypass seccomp by changing
allowed system calls into system calls that would have been denied. So
considering ptrace can still be used to execute arbitrary system calls,
why add this special case restriction to SECCOMP_RET_TRACE?

One case is for system call injection where an arbitrary syscall is
hijacked for the jailer's purposes. But that needs the exit path too.
Another one is replacing fork() with clone(), but that's only necessary
on 2.4. Another one is to let the process call exit() to get rid of it.

But it's easy to get the exit notification by resuming with PTRACE_SYSCALL
after getting a PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP event, so I don't see how it matters
if we're interested in the exit path or not.

In the jailer the first system call after an execve is replaced with a
call to mmap2() to get a read-only shared mapping which is used to avoid
file path modifications and similar races. And when using seccomp all
events are PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP ones, and those are exactly the ones
where we need the shared read-only mapping. We could work around your
ad hoc restriction, but the main thing is if seccomp filters is just
about syscall numbers anyway, then why use BPF instead of a bitmask?

The whole point of PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP is to delegate to ptrace, it
means "we can't decide in the filter, ask the ptracer". This implies
that the ptracer is trusted, so doing any checks afterwards is a bit
pointless. But if you want to do it anyway, at least do it properly
and re-run the filter after ptrace. To avoid loops you need to allow
the syscall if you get another PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP.

As seccomp can generate ptrace events, the only thing that makes sense is
to either do seccomp first and ignore ptrace changes, or rerun filters after
any ptrace changes. But as I said in my other mail, if a process can call
ptrace(), it will pretty much avoid all secomp filters anyway, seccomp
filters which allow ptrace() are pretty much guaranteed to be insecure.
We're talking about a non-seccomped process ptracing a seccomped process,
both with the same UID. I don't think it matters in practice what you do
in this case, from a security point of view.

Greetings,

Indan
