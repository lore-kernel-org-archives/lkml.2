It has been addressed in the standards.

Again, this is being worked on, see http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Atomic/GCCMM

So, let's ignore everyone's craziness (the kernel is not the only GCC
client...) and think about how we can improve the situation.

We need a proper memory model.  No vague assumptions with lots of
hand-waving.  If you think that this is simple stuff and can
sufficiently described by "don't do anything stupid", then please have a
look at the issues that the Java memory model faced, and all the
iterations of the C++11/C11 model and discussions about it.

The only candidate that I see is the C++11/C11 model.  Any other
suggestions?

Now, if we assume this model, what does the kernel community think about
it?  It might be good to split this discussion into the following two
points, to avoid syntax flame wars:
1) The model itself (ie, the memory orders, ordering guarantees, (lack
of) progress guarantees, etc.).
2) The syntax/APIs to specify atomics.

If something else or more is needed, the compiler needs to have a formal
specification for that.  This will help users too, because it avoids all
the ambiguities.

I assume you still would want a weak memory model, or not?  (That is,
rely on data-race-freedom, only atomics do not contribute to data races,
and you need to mark data used for synchronization (or which is just
accessed concurrently) as atomics).

If so, you need to tell the compiler which variables etc. are atomics.

If the compiler is aware what is a lock (or atomics, or similar), then a
correct implementation should leave the lock alone.  But in a weak
memory model, it needs to know what is a lock.
(Same goes for volatile obviously, like in the other example posted in
the thread where the bitfields interfered with the volatile.)

So, would it be okay to tell the compiler which part of the state is
accessed concurrently (ie, locks, atomics, ...)?
