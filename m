I don't recall anyone stating (b) the way you did above (or sufficiently
similar).  I wouldn't consider setuid() never failing to be a security
problem.  BTW, some people consider setuid() failing on RLIMIT_NPROC
kernel "brokenness", which applications have to "work around":

http://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2011/07/21/3

"I'm aware of course that some interfaces *can* fail for nonstandard
reasons under Linux (dup2 and set*uid come to mind), and I've tried to
work around these and shield applications from the brokenness..."

So opinions on setuid() failing vary, whereas (a) is clear - there have
been vulnerabilities caused by setuid() failing.

The DoS that you mention doesn't necessarily have to be dealt with by
setuid() failing on RLIMIT_NPROC (nor on a higher limit).  It could also
be dealt with by checking the limit on execve(), like we've been doing
on shared web hosting servers for years, and, if desired, by letting
applications like Android/Zygote check for the condition themselves via
a new prctl() (or they can simply pass an extra fork(), although that's
a bit costly).

For a malicious user, this merely adds the task of triggering a race
condition - have a sufficient number of processes accumulate in the
between setuid() and execve() state.  If the program in question can be
made to sleep, this may be trivial to do.  Otherwise, it may require
very rapid requests (automated) and high system load.

(BTW, 10% of 0 would be 0, which would allow for attacks that are as
simple as they're now, but that's an implementation detail.  Of course,
you'd actually add some constant as well.)

I generally support having multiple layers of security even if some are
non-perfect, but in this case we have a problem that we can _fully_ deal
with rather than merely make attacks harder.

So my proposal remains to go with Vasiliy's trivial patch and maybe add
a few things on top of it as I mentioned in my previous message.

Thanks,

Alexander
