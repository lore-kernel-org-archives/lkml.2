Yes,

Ah, I misunderstood you. Yes, sure.

Hm, still can't understand...

Probably you meant zap_threads/zap_process, not coredump_wait?

zap_process() is fine, we hold ->siglock. But zap_threads does _not_
start at current, may be you misread the g == tsk->group_leader check
in the main for_each_process() loop ? But most probably we simply
misunderstand each other a bit, see below.

However it starts at ->group_leader, so it won't suffer if we restrict
the lockless while_each_thread_rcu().

I didn't try to grep, but I do not know any example of the lockless
while_each_thread() which starts at current.

I guess this is the source of confusion.

OK, thanks.

I'll try to investigate if we can remove

	leader->group_leader = tsk;

from de_thread(). In fact I already thought about this change a long
ago without any connection to while_each_thread(). This assignment
looks "assymetrical" compared to other threads we kill. But we did
have a reason (reasons?). Hopefully, the only really important reason
was already removed by 087806b1.

Oleg.
