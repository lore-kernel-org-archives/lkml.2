NAK on this in its current form, as it breaks the upcoming x32 ABI.
Selection by ABI needs to be more specific.

However, I have to question the value of this... if this is enabled in
the system as a whole (as opposed to compiled out) it seems kind of
pointless... if there are bugs we need to deal with them anyway.

*YOU* are the person who needs to answer that question by providing
measurements.  Quite frankly I suspect checks in the syscall code *or*
task switching MSRs are going to be unacceptable from a performance
point of view.
