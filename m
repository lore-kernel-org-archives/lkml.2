As I said off-list, it's a pitty that only a root dumper process may
dump a task.  However, for the specific usecase - C/R - it should be OK.

While this is not needed with capable() check, it's OK to keep it for
the future more finegranted access checks.

BTW, not a big deal, but probably you should return -EACCES on
!capable() as file presence is not an issue in this case.

    if (!ptrace_may_access(task, PTRACE_MODE_READ))
        goto out_notask;

    status = -EACCES;
    if (!capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN))
        goto out_notask;

    status = 0;
