Hi,

[This should probably be discussed on LKML for an even wider audience, so
I've added a CC for it there.]

This didn't parse quite right for me. I think you meant that the intent
is to get these features into the upstream Linux kernel, with potential
staging in Ubuntu kernels.

(Also s/PAX/PaX/g)

For people new to this, can you give an overview of what attacks are foiled
by adding overflow protection?

Why was kref introduced? Or rather, how is kref currently different from
atomic_t?
