Sorry, I've been bogged down with work issues and have not had time to
look at it. If someone else wants to take a look while I am busy, I'd
be happy. The patch you've sent seems reasonable, but I'd suggest a
changelog

"Change taskstats user interface, henceforth we need (for security
purposes) CAP_SYS_ADMIN to receive taskstats
data on a particular CPU, a subset or all CPUs on the system. The
patch also rounds the data returned to the KiloByte
boundary for IO parameters, read_bytes, write_bytes and cancelled_write_bytes"

Thanks for looking into this.
Balbir
