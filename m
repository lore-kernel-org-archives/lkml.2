No, but that doesn't mean the disk format has to change when the tools
come out... I just don't want to confuse "there are no tools" with
"the disk format is unstable" - Andreas et. al. have been using
that format for years.

Sorry; I may have just misunderstood...

Yes, I guess I had misunderstood your point; I thought you were
implying that ext4's format had to change to support 64-bit, so why
not change snapshots along with it....

But you're just saying that you wish to push 32-bit snapshots which only
work with certain sizes of ext4 filesystems now, and later you will
release a new snapshot format which works with the larger filesystems.
Right?

(I don't actually know if we'll ever have 64-bit ext4, though, there
are still so many scaling issues beyond just being able to mkfs,
mount, growfs etc ... it's a serious game of catch-up with xfs
in that space, IMHO, which has been doing it well for years now...)

Still, pushing snapshots upstream which will have an on-disk format
more limited than the rest of the filesystem's on-disk format 
does strike me as suboptimal from a pure technical design POV.

What if we proposed, say, xattr code that could only apply xattrs
to files located in the first 16T?  I don't think it'd be accepted.

I understand that you have a history and a format and a business case,
but that really should not change whether we do it right the first time,
upstream, IMHO...  But I'm just the peanut gallery, here....  ;)
