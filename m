Could you clarify what the problem with virtio-blk is?

This is just multiplexing, surely, which should be easily fixable in
virtio-blk?

I assume this means exclusive passthrough?  In which case, why doesn't
passing the host block queue through to the guest just work?  That means
the host is doing all the SCSI back end stuff and you've just got a
lightweight queue pass through.

I don't really understand this comment at all:  The block protocol is
far simpler than SCSI, but includes SG_IO, which can encapsulate all of
the SCSI features ... I'm not familiar necessarily with the problems of
QEMU devices, but surely it can unwrap the SG_IO transport generically
rather than having to emulate on a per feature basis?
