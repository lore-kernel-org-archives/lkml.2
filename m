Also, if one should have an ability to learn IDs of specific object
types and the set of types is very limited, it's much safer to have one
increasing u64 counter for each created object of one of these types.
The exposed to userspace data will be:

    ID = hash(counter ^ cookie)

    cookie is generated at boot time, once.  counter is a single
    variable, one for all exposed kernel object types.

ID will be unpredictable if hash() is cryptographically secure, and
counter is not duplicated.  So, for each newly created object the ID is
the new random value, which is unique and says nothing to userspace about
either kernel object addresses or the counter itself.

The cost:

1) counter storing for each kernel object exposed through this interface.

2) object creation will be slowed down by hash().


Also, one thought - is it safe to say two kernel objects are the same to
userspace? :)  I don't see anything obviously dangerous, though.

Thanks,
