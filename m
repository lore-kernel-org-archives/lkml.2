Sorry for chiming in late on this, but I've been looking at this
problem from the other end as well, from the POV of a fileserver. For
there, you absolutely do want to have some mechanism for enforcing this
on local filesystems. 

Currently, file servers generally enforce share reservations
internally. The upshot is that they're not aware when other tasks
outside the server modify a file. This is also problematic too in many
common fileserving situations -- when exporting files via both NFS and
SMB, for instance.

One thing that's important to note is that there is already some
support for this in the kernel. The LOCK_MAND flag and its associates
are intended for just this purpose. Samba even already calls into the
kernel to set LOCK_MAND locks, but the kernel just passes them through
to the fs. Rumor has it that GPFS does something with these flags, but
I can't confirm that.

Of course, LOCK_MAND is racy since you can't set it on open(), but it
might be nice to use that as a starting point for trying to add this
support.

At the very least, if we're going to do this, we need to consider what
to do with the LOCK_MAND interfaces. As a starting point for
discussion, here's a patch that I was playing with a few months ago. I
haven't had much time to really spend on this project, but it may be
worthwhile to consider. It works, but I'm not sure about the
semantics...

-----------------------------[snip]--------------------------------

locks: add enforcement of LOCK_MAND locks

The LOCK_MAND lock mechanism is currently a no-op for any in-tree
filesystem. The flags are passed to f_ops->flock, but the standard
flock routines basically ignore them.

Change this by adding enforcement against other LOCK_MAND locks. Also,
assume that LOCK_MAND also implies LOCK_NB.
