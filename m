  How did you modify it??

  When testing it, I modify as 
 
    -                       for (j = 0; j < dummy; ++j)
    -                               READ32(dummy);
    +                       p += dummy;

  or
    
    -                       for (j = 0; j < dummy; ++j)
    -                               READ32(dummy);

  Test case CSESS16 and CSESS16a are PASS, 
  I can't get BAD_XDR error as you said.
