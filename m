So if the virtio does not understand chaining at all then surly it will
not understand the 2-bit end marker and will get a wrong page pointer
with the 1st bit set.

As I said!! Since the last code did sg_set_buff() and worked then you must
change it with sg_set_page().

If there are *any* chaining-or-no-chaining markers errors these should
be fixed as a separate patch!

Please lets concentrate at the problem at hand.

Fine then your code is now a crash because the terminating bit was just
copied over, which it was not before.

Now Back to the how to support chaining:

Lets separate the two topics from now on. Send me one mail concerning
the proper above patch, And a different mail for how to support chaining.

I hate that plan. Why yet override the scatter element yet again with a third
union of a "request descriptor"

The reason it was overloaded as a link-pointer in the first place was because
of historical compatibility reasons and not because of a good design.

You should have a proper "request descriptor" structure defined, pointing to
(or followed by), an sglist-chain. And all of the above is mute.

except that with the correct design you don't call sg_chain you just do:
	request_descriptor->sg_list = sg;

I did not understand "constant time" it is O(0) if that what you meant.

(And surly today's code of copy the full list "cache misses")

Each case it's own. If the appended-to chain is const, yes you'll have
to reallocate it and copy. Is that your case?
