I did not see a similar error in the log file you provided.

The above problem appeared to be triggered by the reset_devices path (e.g. kdump) picking
up completions from the previous kernel, due to the device not actually being reset.
All the Smart arrays since the p600 can't be reset by the PCI power management
method.  Some of them can be reset by using the "doorbell" register, and a patch
for hpsa to do this has been implemented, this one:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=127671403229420&w=2

which is one patch in a series of other patches to hpsa.

I am currently working on a similar series of patches for cciss.

However, this won't help the P400, P400i, E500, P800, and P700m, which cannot
be reset by either method.  Also, the 6402 and 6404, while they can
be reset, it's inadvisable since they share a battery backed cache 
module, hence this patch to hpsa:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=127671403029407&w=2
