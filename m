I surveyed the h_hash/e_hash calculation code; it only covers the name and
value fields.  Do we care about checksum protection for the extra fields in
struct ext4_xattr_header and struct ext4_xattr_entry?  I think it would be
useful to be able to check the sanity of h_refcount and h_blocks.  Possibly
that extends to e_value_* as well, though the hash probably covers it.  Also,
there's no hardware acceleration available for the xattr hash, though I doubt
xattrs are especially performance sensitive.
