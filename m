Two separate issues.  For one thing the nfs code simply doesn't seem
to handle changing directories very well, and one and a half the Linux
NFS server might even send incoherent readdir output in a single
protocol reply.

Issue two is that the ext3/4 hashed directory format is too simply (not
to say dumb) to provide a proper 32-bit linear value for the dirent
d_off field.  It's not a complex task, and the first relatively simple
generation of xfs btree directories couldn't handle it either.  The
v2 directory format handles it fine, but at the cost of a much more
complex codebase.
