Sure, and that's something one would configure. So I'm not sure I see
how exposing the different hardware bits via a clock_id is problematic.
They're just clocks that are being exposed. The steering of system time
to PTP or PTP to system time  (or just PTP to other PTP clocks).

Ok. So its just the issue of clock_id reuse. I was confusing it with
some sort of module use counting issue.  And yea, I can see how it might
be  easier to re-use the file descriptor then re-implementing the reuse
logic in the posix-clock registration.

Right, which was what I was thinking as well, but assuming we didn't
re-use clockids quickly.

Wait, you're suggesting we add new fclock_* calls that duplicate the
posix interface? That doesn't sound great to me.

What did you think of Kyle Moffett's suggestion of utilizing the fd to
map to the clock_id which could then be used by the posix clocks
interface?

Although I'm still not sure if it wouldn't be so hard to just simply
increment the id on each registration and index to a clock through a
reasonably small hash table. I suspect that would solve the
enumeration/reuse issue without much trouble (but again, I'm open to
being corrected if I'm missing something larger).

But yes, in summary, this is an issue to be addressed one way or
another.
