Heh, who runs a tree is both politics and technical.

For a storage git tree to be usable as a stable base, it has to be the
upstream tree.  That would mean that, like net, the way upstream would
be via this tree.  That's quite a shift in the way we currently work.

This sort of thing doesn't get decided by fiat.  If you can't get all of
the relevant parties to agree, you have to demonstrate the need.  So
doing a rollup tree to test how much of the problem is solvable that way
seems like a reasonable first step.
