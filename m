Most are system tuning; this is directly related to vulnerability
mitigation. Besides, I like having CONFIGs for sysctls because then I
can build my kernel the way I want it without having to worry about
tweaking my userspace sysctl.conf file, or run newer kernels on older
userspaces, etc etc.

I couldn't disagree more. There has been zero evidence of this change
causing anything but regressions in _attacks_. :P If anything, I think
there should be no CONFIG and no sysctl, and it should be entirely
non-optional. But since this patch needs consensus, I have provided
knobs to control it. This is the way of security features. For
example, years back I added a knob for /proc/$pid/maps protection
being optional (and defaulted it to insecure because of people's fear
of regression), and eventually it changed to secure-by-default, and
then the knob went away completely because it didn't actually cause
problems.
