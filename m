Such as? If we don't use well known, well defined terminology, we
end up with ambiguous, vague functionality and inconsistent
implementations.

And that's -exactly- the ambiguous, vague definition that has raised
all these questions in the first place. I was in doubt about whether
unwritten extents can be considered a hole, and by your definition
that means it should be data. But Andreas seems to be in no doubt it
should be considered a hole.

Hence if I implement XFS support and Andreas implements ext4 support
by your defintion, we end with vastly different behaviour even
though the two filesystems use the same underlying technology for
preallocated ranges. That's exactly the inconsistency in
implementation that I'd like us to avoid.

IOWs, the definition needs to be clear enough to prevent these
inconsistencies from occurring. Indeed, the phrase "preallocated
ranges that have not had data written to them" is as independent of
filesystem implementation or technologies as possible. However,
because Linux supports preallocation (unlike our reference
platform), and we encourage developers to use it where appropriate,
it is best that we define how we expect such ranges to behave
clearly. That makes life easier for everyone.

Cheers,

Dave.
