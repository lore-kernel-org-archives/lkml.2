Dave,

as you suggested, we reverted "ext4: Avoid group preallocation for
closed files" and this indeed fixes a big part of the problem: after
booting the NFS server we get

NFS-Server: turn5 2.6.32.16p i686
NFS-Client: turn10 2.6.18-194.8.1.el5 x86_64

exported directory on the nfs-server:
/dev/md5 /mnt/md5 ext4
rw,seclabel,noatime,barrier=1,stripe=512,data=writeback 0 0

 48 seconds for preparations
 28 seconds to rsync 100 frames with 597M from nfs directory
 57 seconds to rsync 100 frames with 595M to nfs directory
 70 seconds to untar 24353 kernel files with 323M to nfs directory
 57 seconds to rsync 24353 kernel files with 323M from nfs directory
133 seconds to run xds_par in nfs directory
425 seconds to run the script


For blktrace details, see my next email which is a response to Ted's.

best,

Kay
