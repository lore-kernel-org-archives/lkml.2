But what is *within* the bitfield?  Do you consider s4 or t2 fields
(non-bitfield fields that just the ABI wants to pack together with
the bitfield) above as *within* or is already modifying of those a problem?

The reason we mention C11/C++11 memory model is because we plan to support
that, likely for GCC 4.8, when requested by some options (either by default
when choosing those standards?, or when explicitly requested).  This will
even disable some optimizations that are fine for single-threaded apps,
but aren't fine in those memory models, aren't fine in OpenMP or for many
other threaded programs.  E.g. loop store motion if it isn't guaranteed the
variable is always stored in the loop:
int x;

void
foo (int j)
{
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < 100000; i++)
    if (i > j)
      x = i;
}
can't be performed, because otherwise it introduces a tmp = x; ... x = tmp;
into code that wouldn't otherwise touch the variable, so if some other
thread modifies x, it might have unexpected value.
