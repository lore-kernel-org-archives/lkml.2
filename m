Well, if it's for ATA only then the better course would be extracting
libata from scsi.  It's also a bit misleading to do sizings on x86,
because that doesn't imply embedded to me.  Aren't there still ATAPI
devices that require the quirks?

Most embedded setups include some form of USB ... again, the pluggable
CD/DVD use the quirks table.

Given the potential for disaster even on embedded systems, I don't
really think something like this is a good idea.
