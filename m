  Currently it won't. The above relies on the fact that when we clear dirty
page flag in clear_page_dirty_for_io we also write-protect the page.
Moreover I suppose you don't set PageWriteback when serving a content from
a page...
  But an elegant way to solve this would IMHO be to do:
	lock_page(page);
	if (page_mkclean(page))
		set_page_dirty(page);
  and now you can be sure that until you unlock the page it cannot be
modified because both ->page_mkwrite and ->write_begin need page lock
before they can go and modify a page...
