Here's an ext4 version of the debugging patch.  It's a few years old but
it'll give you the idea.  This only covers metadata pages.

Looks like I hacked the btrfs version up and didn't keep the original,
I'll have to rework it, I was trying to use it for the big corruption I
fixed recently and made a bunch of changes.

For data if mmap is giving you trouble you need to wait on writeback in
page_mkwrite, with the page locked.  fs/btrfs/inode.c has our
page_mkwrite, which uses wait_on_page_writeback() and also the btrfs
ordered write code.  But for the other filesystems, waiting on writeback
should be enough.
