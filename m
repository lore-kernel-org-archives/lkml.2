  Would be nicer, yes.

  Yes, after some thinking I came to that conclusion. We actually need to
keep i_mutex around ext4_flush_unwritten_io() to avoid livelocks but the
rest doesn't need it. The change should be definitely a separate patch just
in case there's something subtle I missed and we need to bisect in
future... I've attached a patch for that so that blame for bugs goes my way
;) Compile tested only so far. I'll give it some more testing overnight.

Subject: [PATCH] ext4: Reduce i_mutex usage in ext4_file_sync()

ext4_file_sync() needs i_mutex only to avoid livelocks of
ext4_flush_unwritten_io() all other code doesn't need it. In particular
syncing of inode & metadata in non-journal case is safe (writeback doesn't
hold i_mutex either) and forcing of transaction commits doesn't need i_mutex
either (there's nothing inode specific in that code apart from grabbing
transaction ids from the inode). So shorten the span where i_mutex is held.
