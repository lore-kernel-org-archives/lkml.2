If we both agree that there has to be a request for an open stateid for
a write, then instead of returning the read delegation if the client receives
err_openmode (when it send the request with read delegation stateid
as you said per 3560bis), can't the client resend the setattr with the open
stateid? The ordering of the stateid usage is a "should" and not a "must".

In rfc5661, it really doesn't make sense to ever send a setattr with
a read delegation stateid. According to 9.1.2, the server "MUST" return
err_open_mode" error in that case.

I gather you are in this case dealing with 4.0 delegations. But I wonder
if you'll do something else for 4.1 delegation then?

Another comment is that I was suggesting a return of delegation only
because (from what i recall) the 4.1 servers out there will recall the
previously
given read delegation in this case.

Can that really happen since we agreed that the client also has an open
stateid for write in this case?
