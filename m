Emacs: why choose between a word processor and a Lisp interpreter when you could have neither instead?

Done. (Also checked the effect of your patches posted earlier this week:
no effect, I'm afraid, certainly not under the fails-even-on-3.6.1 test
I was carrying out, umount -l'ing /var as the very last thing I did
before /sbin/reboot -f.)

nobarrier makes a difference that I, at least, did not expect:

[no options]                    No corruption

nobarrier                       No corruption

          journal_checksum      Corruption
                                Corrupted transaction, journal aborted
                                
nobarrier,journal_checksum      Corruption
                                Corrupted transaction, journal aborted

          journal_async_commit  Corruption
                                Corrupted transaction, journal aborted

nobarrier,journal_async_commit  Corruption
                                No corrupted transaction or aborted journal

I didn't expect the last case at all, and it adequately explains why you
are mostly seeing corrupted journal messages in your tests but I was
not. It also explains why when I saw this for the first time I was able
to mount the resulting corrupted filesystem read-write and corrupt it
further before I noticed that anything was wrong.

It is also clear that journal_checksum and all that relies on it is
worse than useless right now, as Eric reported while I was testing this.
It should probably be marked CONFIG_BROKEN in future 3.[346].* stable
kernels, if CONFIG_BROKEN existed anymore, which it doesn't.

It's a shame journal_async_commit depends on a broken feature: it might
be notionally unsafe but on some of my systems (without nobarrier or
flashy caching controllers) it was associated with a noticeable speedup
of metadata-heavy workloads -- though that was way back in 2009...
however, "safety first" definitely applies in this case.
