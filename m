Oh, you'd want the bdi as well. And as I said, I don't think it was
workable, just trying to think it over and consider potentially other
ways to accomplish this.

At one point I had a patch that did the equivalant of this yield on
being scheduled out on the CPU side, which is probably why I was in the
ioc mindset.
