In the various kernel/user split implementations, I completely agree
that the open-iscsi is more difficult and painful than what Tomo has
proposed..

However, my main issue is still with moving the default login paths to a
single threaded userspace daemon that needs to be fully aware of lots of
dynaminc state changes in /sys/kernel/config/target/iscsi.  Implementing
a userspace daemon that needs to be aware of this is going to require an
kernel/user split quickly moving towards the 'break up every operation
into a different call' arena, that puts us back open-iscsi type split
terrority.

Fair point.  I would also expect HW iscsi to integrate into the same
control plane and python library for an consistent API to application
devels here.
