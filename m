It's not just a log issue, it's a userspace tool issue, which is not
addressed here at all.

Actually I don't think this solves the log issue either, but that's
a different point...

Once it becomes a userspace api, it's almost impossible to ever remove,
you know that.

And as you agree this is a hack, and it really doesn't provide the
correct solution, why should it have been accepted?

Again, this is fixable in userspace, the author of the patch agrees with
that, yet refuses to make the userspace changes despite having a few
_years_ in which to so so.

Also, you should have gotten this through the block layer maintainer...
