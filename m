Thanks a lot for posting these, I know it takes forever to run them.

I hesitate to trust postmark too much for comparing the ext4 trim with
the btrfs trim because we might have dramatically different lifetimes on
the blocks.  So if I manage to just do fewer allocations than ext4, I'll
also do fewer trims.

I'd also be curious to see how many trims each of us did, maybe running
w/blktrace could show that?

The btrfs online discard will trim all the metadata blocks as they are
freed, and in a COW filesystem this makes for a very noisy trim.  We
could reduce our trim load considerably by only trimming data blocks,
and only trimming metadata when we make a big free extent.

The default btrfs options duplicate metadata, so we actually end up
doing 2 trims for every metadata block we free.

At any rate, I definitely think both the online trim and the FITRIM have
their uses.  One thing that has burnt us in the past is coding too much
for the performance of the current crop of ssds when the next crop ends
up making our optimizations useless.

This is the main reason I think the online trim is going to be better
and better.  The FS has a ton of low hanging fruit in there and the
devices are going to improve.  At some point the biggest perf problem
will just be the non-queueable trim command.

One thing I haven't seen benchmarked is how trim changes the performance
of the SSD as the poor little log structured squirrels inside run out
of places to store things.  Does it get rid of the cliffs in performance as
the drive ages, and how do we measure that in general?
