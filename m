Sure, I've read it and included the link in the patch description :)

Closing only slabinfo doesn't add any significant protection against
kernel heap exploits per se, no objections here.  

But as said in the desciption, the reason for this patch is not protecting
against exploitation heap bugs.  It is a source of infoleaks of kernel
and userspace activity, which should be forbidden to non-root users.

One note: only to _kernel_ developers.  It means it is a strictly
debugging feature, which shouldn't be enabled in the production systems.

Thanks,
