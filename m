I had trouble understanding why lib/uuid.c existed, since the only
thing I saw was the uuid generation function.  After some more
looking, I see you also created inline functions which wrapped
memcmp().

The problem I have with your abstractions is that it just makes life
more complicated for the callers.  All of the current places which use
generate_random_uuid() merely want to fill in a unsigned char array.
This includes btrfs, by the way, which is already using
generate_random_uuid in some places, and I'm not sure why they are
using uuid_le_gen(), since there doesn't seem to be any need for a
little-endian uuid/guid here (it's just used as unique bag of bits
which is 16 bytes long), and using uuid_le_gen() means extra memory
has to be allocated on the stack, and then an extra memory copy is
required.  Contrast (in fs/btrfs/root-tree.c):

	   uuid_le uuid;
	   ...
		uuid_le_gen(&uuid);
		memcpy(item->uuid, uuid.b, BTRFS_UUID_SIZE);

versus, simply doing (fs/btrfs/volumes.c):

	generate_random_uuid(fs_devices->fsid);

see which one is easier?  And after the uuid is generated, none of the
current callers ever do any manipulation of the uuid, so there's no
real point to play fancy typedef games; it just adds more work for no
real gain.

Well, technially GUID is "intel/little-endian byte order".  If someone
tried to implement the GPT on a big-endian system, such as PowerPC,
they would still have to use the little-endian byte order, even though
it's not the native byte order for that architecture.  Otherwise
devices wouldn't be portable between those systems.  (This is why I
think the GUID was such a bad idea; everyone basically treats them as
16 byte octet strings, so this whole idea of "native byte order" just
to save a few byte swaps at UUID generation time was really, IMHO, a
very bad idea.)
