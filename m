Hi Eric,

thanks for the answer.

Ok, I will try to patch something in and see what happens if I hit it

Interesting modules?
alsa stuff, bluetooth, fuse/fat/vfat for ntfs/external drives, wlan
the only thing that stand out is the vbox* I guess, all the others are
pretty standard, aren't they?

Best wishes

Norbert
