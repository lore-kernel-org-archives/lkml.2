Subject: [PATCH 6/6] block: remove RQ_NOIDLE from WRITE_SYNC
Date: Fri,  2 Jul 2010 15:58:19 -0400
Message-Id: <1278100699-24132-7-git-send-email-jmoyer@redhat.com>
In-Reply-To: <1278100699-24132-1-git-send-email-jmoyer@redhat.com>

X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In trying to get fsync-ing processes to perform as well under CFQ as they
do in deadline, I found (with the current blk_yield approach) that it was
necessary to get rid of the RQ_NOIDLE flag for WRITE_SYNC I/O.  Instead,
we do explicit yielding of the I/O scheduler.

Comments, as always, are greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
Jeff
