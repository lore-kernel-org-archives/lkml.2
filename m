Oh yeah, I did.  :-)

That's true.  I didn't want to go too advanced on it.  I wanted
something which is fairly mechanical (without intricate parameters)
and effective enough for common cases.

Sure, not applying C2 and 3 if the underlying device supports REQ_FUA
would probably be the most compelling change of the bunch; however,
please keep in mind that issuing flush as soon as possible doesn't
necessarily result in better performance.  It's inherently a balancing
act between latency and throughput.  Even inducing artificial issue
latencies is likely to help if done right (as the ioscheds do).

So, I think it's better to start with something simple and improve it
with actual testing.  If the current simple implementation can match
Darrick's previous numbers, let's first settle the mechanisms.  We can
tune the latency/throughput balance all we want later.  Other than the
double buffering contraint (which can be relaxed too but I don't think
that would be necessary or a good idea) things can be easily adjusted
in blk_kick_flush().  It's intentionally designed that way.

I don't really think we should design the whole thing around broken
devices which incorrectly report writeback cache when it need not.
The correct place to work around that is during device identification
not in the flush logic.

Again, issuing flushes as fast as possible isn't necessarily better.
It might feel counter-intuitive but it generally makes sense to delay
flush if there are a lot of concurrent flush activities going on.
Another related interesting point is that with flush merging,
depending on workload, there's a likelihood that FUA, even if the
device supports it, might result in worse performance than merged DATA
+ single POSTFLUSH sequence.

Thanks.
