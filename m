Oh, got it, thanks.  Yes, now I remember I've seen that problem before.

Perhaps we should be more careful about tweaks to that calculation that
may result in a decreased r/wsize.  You could also get into the same
situation if you took the server down to change the amount of RAM, but
only if you were *removing* memory, which is probably unusual.

Best might be if distributions set max_block_size--it should be easier
for userspace to remember the value across reboots.

While we're at it we also want to create an /etc/nfsd.conf that rpc.nfsd
could read, for setting this, and number of threads, and a few other
things.  The systemd people would prefer that to the current practice of
sourcing a shell script in /etc/sysconfig or /etc/default.

We could warn about this problem ("don't decrease max_block_size on a
server without unmounting clients first") next to that variable in the
config file.

I think we can do the same calculation as nfsd_create_serv() does from
userspace to set an initial default.  I don't know if that should happen
on package install or on first run of rpc.nfsd.

For now that's a project looking for a volunteer, though.
