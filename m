Ok, thanks for explanation.
So, this pseudoroot looks like a part of NFS server internal implementation, but 
not a part of a standard. That's good.

I've just realized, that this per-sb grace period won't work.
I.e., it's a valid situation, when two or more containers located on the same 
filesystem, but shares different parts of it. And there is not conflict here at all.
I don't see any clear and simple way how to handle such races, because otherwise 
we have to tie network namespace and filesystem namespace.
I.e. there will be required some way to define, was passed export directory 
shared already somewhere else or not.

Realistic solution - since export check should be done in initial file system 
environment (most probably container will have it's own root), then we to pass 
this data to some kernel thread/userspace daemon in initial file system 
environment somehow (sockets doesn't suits here... Shared memory?).

Improbable solution - patching VFS layer...
