No.  But I'm comparing to 3.5 + butchery to remove stable pages.  With
stable pages on, this workload performs terribly.  (It's a soft
real-time thing, as you can possibly guess from my domain name, and
various latency monitoring things go nuts when stable pages are
active.)

Actually, performance appears to be improved, probably due to
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/14/14, which I tested concurrently.

My pleasure.  When these changes go in to an upstream kernel, they'll
represent a significant reduction in how much our kernel differs from
kernel.org's :)  Thanks for fixing this.
