One more thing, the most important one. We have already fixed that in the
past and I was hoping the lesson was learned. Apparently it was not, and
we are doomed to do this mistake for ever!!

What ever crap fails times out and crashes, in the recovery code, we don't
give a dam. It should never affect any Server-client communication.

When the grace periods ends the clients gates opens period. *Any* error
return from state recovery code must be carefully ignored and normal
operations resumed. At most on error, we move into a mode where any
recovery request from client is accepted, since we don't have any better
data to verify it.

Please comb recovery code to make sure any catastrophe is safely ignored.
We already did that before and it used to work.
