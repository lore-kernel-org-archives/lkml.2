OK, coming back after reviewing Documentation/workqueue.txt: the
workqueues potentially involved here are rpciod and the server's
laundromat and callback workqueues.

The former is created with

	alloc_workqueue("rpciod", WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, 1);

and the latter two are both created with
create_singlethread_workqueue(), which also sets WQ_MEM_RECLAIM.

As I understand it, that ensures that each of the three has at least one
"rescuer" thread dedicated to it--so there shouldn't be any deadlock as
long as there's no circular dependency among the three.

So think this is a false positive--am I missing something?

No, the waiting's intentional: for example, the laundromat wq is what's
responsible for reaping expired clients, and it wants to wait for
callback rpc's to exit.  (If I remember right they may reference data
structures we're about to clean up).
