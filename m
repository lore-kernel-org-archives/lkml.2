Don't make it an option, though.  If you must use hueristics, then at
least *try* to make the hueristics smarter.  If the file name falls
into certain patterns, such as:

     fs/*/*.[ch]
     drivers/scsi/*/*.[ch]
     drivers/net/*/*.[ch]

etc., then you really should be doing the analysis by subdirectory,
and not by file.

There's something very simple you can do that would help.  Don't make
it easy for people to do

   mail $(./get_maintainer.pl) < annoying-e-mail

Instead have get_maintainer.pl always be very verbose, and have it
*explain* what it is doing, so that in order for someone to use the
damn thing, they have to read the text while they are finding the
e-mail address to cut and paste out of its output.

I really dislike training people that using dumb scripts is a good
idea.  Tools like that just plain shouldn't exist, if they are that
subject to error.  If you can clean up the tool to the point where the
error rate is manageable, maybe, perhaps.

But what was shipped as part of 2.6.35 was really, really, *REALLY*
bad.  It makes me wonder how much testing someone did with the
hueristics before turning it loose for the newbies to use.
