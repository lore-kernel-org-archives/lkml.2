and I was not.  Doubly prefixed was as I said, doubly prefixed.
ext4_msg wasn't a consistently used interface.

Umm, ext4_msg does call printk.

It's hard to say that's true.
Look at the the trace_<foo> mechanisms.
Very useful stuff but once set, there's
been a strong desire to set the output
as an unchangeable ABI.

So I think defining the output correctly
_first_ is the most important element of
any notification mechanism.  TLV use in
the output generally isn't human parsable
and there's value in that readability.
