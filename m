OK, so here are the reasons why I chose not doing this :
---------------------------------------------------------

1) When I wrote this code, I _wanted_ keeping the original BPF around
for post morterm analysis. When we are 100% confident code is bug free,
we might remove the "BPF source code", but I am not convinced.

2) Most filters are less than 1 Kbytes, and who run thousands of BPF
network filters on a machine ? Do you have real cases ? Because in these
cases, the vmalloc() PAGE granularity might be a problem anyway.


Some filters are setup for a very short period of time...
(tcpdump for example setup a "ret 0" at the very beginning of a capture
). Doing the extra kmalloc()/copy/kfree() is a loss.

tcpdump -n -s 0 -c 1000 arp

I dont think so, check git history if you want :)

You miss the point : 99.999 % of offsets are positive in filters.

Best is to not call load_pointer() and only call skb_copy_bits() if the
data is not in skb head, but in some fragment.

I dont know, I never had to use negative offsets in my own filters.
So in the BPF JIT I said : If we have a negative offset in a filter,
just disable JIT code completely for this filter (lines 478-479).

Same for fancy instructions like BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR /
BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR_NEST

Show me a real use first.

I am pragmatic : I spend time coding stuff if there is a real need.

Its not superflous, see my comment at the end of this mail.

This code is optimized away by the compiler, you know that ?

Adding "add 127 to rdi" is one more instruction, adding dependencies and
making out slow path code more complex (calls to skb_copy_bits() in
bpf_jit.S ...). Thats a bad idea.

I see no change in your patch in the code generation.

if (filter[i].jt == 0), we want to EMIT_COND_JMP(f_op, f_offset);
because we know at this point that filter[i].jf != 0) [ line 536 ]

if (filter[i].jt != 0), the break; in line 583 prevents the
EMIT_COND_JMP(f_op, f_offset);

Thanks !
