You mean we don't need hot_inode_tree? You know, after those hook
functions collect the freq data for inode, they will store those raw
info in hot_inode_tree. One private kthread will iterate this tree to
distill those raw freq data into one temperatue value in [0 ~ 255],
then link the corresponding hot_inode_item in heat map.
