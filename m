Hmm...

Maybe I missed patch [0/5] or I haven't got it. Anyway I haven't see it.
Can you please describe your use case? Why do we need two new hidepid mode?
Moreover, if we use hidepid=[12], it may break some procps tools. What do
you think about compatibility issue? And, why don't you use just pid namespace?

I'm sorry if you already answered.
