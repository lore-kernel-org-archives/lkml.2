This is nit-picking but totalreserve_pages is a poor name because it's
a per-zone value that is one of the lowmem_reserve[] fields instead
of a total. After this patch, we have zone->totalreserve_pages and
totalreserve_pages but are not related to the same thing.
but they are not the same.

It gets confusing once you consider what the values are
for. lowmem_reserve is part of a placement policy that limits the
number of pages placed in lower zones that allocated from higher
zones. totalreserve_pages is related to the overcommit heuristic
where it is assuming that the most interesting type of allocation
is GFP_HIGHUSER.

This begs the question - what is this new field, where does it come
from, what does it want from us? Should we take it to our Patch Leader?

This field ultimately affects what zone is used to allocate a new
page so it's related to placement policy. That implies the naming then
should indicate it is related to lowmem_reserve - largest_lowmem_reserve?

Alternative, make it clear that it's one of the lowmem_reserve
values and store the index instead of the value - largest_reserve_idx?

This is highmem so zone->totalreserve_pages should always be 0.

Otherwise, the patch seems fine.
