I like the idea but wonder about some of the details.

Basically the problem is that you find yourself at the
keyboard of a server with a non-trivial storage set up
where something is wrong. The device names that a tool
like lsscsi shows (by default) are device nodes in
the /dev directory. For whatever reason those names may
not match what dmesg and kernel logs are showing.

Whether Greg likes it or not, pretty well all user space
tools and those who use them, look around the /dev directory
for devices **.

lsscsi by default shows the first name in the /dev directory
that matches the major and minor in
/sys/block/<kernel_name>/dev ***. With the '--kname' option
lsscsi will show the kernel (/sys/block) device name instead.


As James' notes each storage device can only have one
"preferred name" at a time. But how can that preferred name
be represented in sysfs ? If /sys/block/<kernel_name>
suddenly changed to /sys/block/<preferred_name> that would
be very disruptive. I would prefer something like
/sys/class/block_preferred_name/<preferred_name> was introduced
as a symlink to /sys/block/<kernel_name> but that would require
that all <preferred_name>s were unique. [Not a bad restriction
IMO]. If the <preferred_name> was only placed in the
/sys/block/<kernel_name> directory that would be ugly from
the user space tool point of view.


**  I write several storage user space tools and can only
     think of one instance where a sysfs "device" node is
     accepted (smp_utils with the sgv4(bsg) interface) and
     that is in addition to a /dev/bsg device node.

*** lsscsi could be smarter and drill down through /dev 's
     sub-directories until a match is found. It could also
     flag that the /dev name and the kernel_name are
     different.
