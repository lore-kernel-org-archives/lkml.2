  Yes.

  Which many places are you speaking about? Grep shows 4 places with
sb->s_dirt = 1;
  You remove two of those in your cleanups so only
__ext4_handle_dirty_super() remains. That is called from 3 (4 after your
cleanups) places and they happen so rarely (during filesystem resize or
when we start using some feature on the filesystem) that if you use
sync_buffer() from all of them, it should be fine.

  Then we have ext4_mark_super_dirty() call from 4 places - I forgot about
these originally... I kind of miss their purpose. Originally they were used
so that we write total number of free blocks and inodes in the superblock
but when we do not maintain them in the journal mode I don't see a reason
to periodically sync them in no-journal mode. Ted, what is the purpose of
these calls?
