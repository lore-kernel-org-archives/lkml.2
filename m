Also add the missing 'n' in "account".

No, the text is correct as it stands.  There are many devices, but
there are only two power states: active and suspended.  For example,
it's perfectly correct to say "All five devices are in the suspended
state" -- and it would be wrong to say "All five are in the suspended
states" (that makes it sound as if the states are suspended rather 
than the devices being suspended).
