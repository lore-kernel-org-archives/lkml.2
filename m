Hi Yongqiang,

I am using kernel version 3.0.8. Looking through the file super.c, the=20
file already has the code mentioned on the web. I also noticed the date of=
=20
the post (http://lists.openwall.net/linux-ext4/2011/03/29/5) is back from=
=20
March of 2011. I think the bug I reported here was not fixed by that patch=
=20
since the kernel version I am using is much newer than March 2011.

I am not sure if I understand what you mean by "commit 0449641130 ext4"?

Thanks,

Darko
