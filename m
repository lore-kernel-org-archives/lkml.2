Well, sure. I was actually planning to rip out SLUB merging completely
because it makes /proc/slabinfo so useless but never got around doing
that. Mixing up allocations makes heap exploits harder but there's no
agreement on how much more difficult (i.e. if it matters at all for brute
force attacks).

So dunno what's the right thing to do here. Every time I discuss the
issues with 'security folks' I'm left with more questions than answers...
Everybody seems to be more interested in closing down kernel ABIs
rather than making kernel memory allocations more robust against
attacks.

But anyway, if you feel about this strongly feel free to pick up
Vasiliy's patch. I think my suggestion of introducing a
CONFIG_RESTRICT_PROCFS makes most sense because:

  - When we've mucked around with /proc/slabinfo in the past, we have
    broken setups. (That might be less relevant now.)

  - /proc/slabinfo is not the only source where you can get information
    on kernel memory allocations (we have one in sysfs and perf kmem).

We have this in /proc/meminfo:

Slab:              20012 kB

Or did you mean something even more specific?
