Ordering should not be an issue.  What were problems when I tried this
before is that we currently assume in the block layer that discard
bios have a valid bi_sector/bi_size, which is already needed e.g. for
the trivial remapping use for partitions and that they don't have
a payload.  You'd need to teach various places that discard payloads
may have a payload, which contains multiple ranges that have a
sector/len tuple that needs to be remapped and checked in various
places.
