For a regular file, mapping->host->i_sb points to the superblock this
file is on.  For a device, mapping->host->i_sb points to the superblock
corresponding to this device.  So it's always what we want.

(hm, what about block devices not currently mounted?  do we need to check
whether mapping->host is NULL?)
