As I said earlier, the split is pretty simple for target code unlike
initiator code. Doing operations before SCSI nexus establishment in
userspace and then the kernel takes over nexuses. The information that
the user space needs for the login negotiation is exported via
configfs. Unlike open-iscsi split, the nexuses don't go back and forth
between user and kernel space.

ok, I implemented something like that. It's not finished at all but
my open-iscsi box successfully logged in. The daemon just passes a file
descriptor to kernel space after the negotiation finishes.
