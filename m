A repost when rc1 has been cut is what's been suggested to me.

Additionally, two tweaks have been pointed out off list (documentation
cruft and lack if #ifdef for asm/syscall.h), which I have fixed in my
local and github tree but haven't yet reposted here.  I was planning
on just posting v17 when rc1 is cut (unless I've blithely missed it
already) and then trying to pester everyone and anyone who can merge.
:)

Maybe someone more authoritative than me will answer though.

thanks!
will
