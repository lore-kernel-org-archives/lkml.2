This is another layering violation:  the page is allocated in the Upper
layer and freed in the mid-layer.

I really hate these growing contortions for discard.  They're a clear
signal that we haven't implemented it right.

So let's first work out how it should be done.  I really like Tomo's
idea of doing discard through the normal REQ_TYPE_FS route, which means
we can control the setup in prep and the tear down in done, all confined
to the ULD.

Where I think I'm at is partially what Christoph says:  The command
transformation belongs in the ULD so that's where the allocation and
deallocation should be, and partly what Tomo says in that we should
eliminate the special case paths.

The payload vs actual request size should be a red herring if we've got
everything correct:  only the ULD cares about the request parameters.
Once we've got everything set up, the mid layer and LLD should only care
about the parameters in the command, so we can confine the size changing
part to the ULD doing the discard.

Could someone take a stab at this and see if it works without layering
violations or any other problematic signals?

Thanks,

James
