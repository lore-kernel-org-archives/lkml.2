I largely consider this (moving man pages to kernel.org) a technical
solution to what is fundamentally a social problem (developers
reluctant to write documentation), and doubt that the technical
solution would make much difference. I'd love to be proved wrong, but
the experiment would require significant start-up effort. (My
collected thoughts on this can be found here:
http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/todo.html#migrate_to_kernel_source.
Note the alternative idea of patch tags mentioned at the end of that
text.)

Unless, or until there's a paid maintainer, I don't expect things to
get significantly better than what they currently are. The quite
significant improvements in man-pages since 2004, when I became
maintainer were in small part due to the fact that I was for a short
period paid to do the work, but in much larger part due to a huge
private effort over those years which over the last couple of years is
no longer unsustainable for me (man-pages is in competition with
requirements for my attention from family, working life, and
(seriously!) seismic events),

Cheers,

Michael
