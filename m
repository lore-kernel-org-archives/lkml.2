This is just a forward port of Jen's patch. I guess I'll have to
clean it up some more...

OK.

I guess so. I'd forgotten that this was in the original patch....

OK.

Every other trace event header does this, so if it's wrong then the

the tracing code to know why this is done, and I'm not keen to
address such a mistake here...
