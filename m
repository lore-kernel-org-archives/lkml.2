Hi Lukas,

I am very glad to have you as my reviewer and critic :-)
I am saying that with all honesty, because I know that you are impartial
and have no anti-ext4 agenda.

LVM multisnap does look like a big leap forward, but you should not
be blinded by the promised feature, before you inspect the implementation,
the same as you are doing to ext4 snapshots now...

I could suggest that you put your root fs on a QCOW2 file exported as NBD.
That would give you both thin provisioning and snapshots, but you know
perfectly well, that this is not a 'good enough' solution.
I'm not saying that LVM is comparable to QCOW2 virtual volume.
I'm just saying we (included myself) should carefully examine the alternatives
before make a ruling against one of them.

Amir.
