The downside to this is if the upcall is taking a long time (for instance, if networking is not available).  It would double the amount of time for svc_register() to return a failure.

(Roel Kluin, could you revise and resubmit that?  I'd do it in two
patches: first just fix the bug you found, but just use a "goto out" or
a "return" instead; then fix the lack of cleanup if you can.)
