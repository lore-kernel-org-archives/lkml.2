Hi Amir,

thanks very much for the resend. I'll take a look at the whole patch
series, but first I want to bring up one important thing.

While this being a huge feature for ext4 (regardless on how
intrusive it is for the usual code paths) and while we already have
patches in the list with people interesting in looking into them, you
should clearly clarify what is the gain of it, what is the use case (and
I know you have one), and why it is better than other approaches. You
know, advertise it a bit in the marketing way :).

There is some confusion among developers on what actually are benefits
of ext4 snapshots in comparison to btrfs, or in comparison to the new
dm_multisnap code. I know that you have done quite a lot of testing to
assure that it does not actually change old ext4 behavior when snapshot
disabled, and that it works well when enabled, but have you done any
performance related benchmarks ? Do you have any expectations on how it
should behave in different work loads ?

It would be great to see and be able to confirm that ext4 snapshots are
really a win, not only on the feature side, but on the performance side
as well. I know that there are people out there still undecided or
having a strange feeling about your snapshot work. But who can blame
them, when we have not seen any hard data on this matter ?

So I, for myself, and I believe there are others, would like to see some
benchmark numbers and comparison (both, features and performance) with at
least new dm-multisnap code and probably btrfs and plain ext4 as well.

Thanks!
-Lukas
