well, that depends.  For us on parisc, kmap of a user page in !HIGHMEM
sets up an inequivalent aliase still ... because the cache colour of the
user and kernel virtual addresses are different.  Depending on the
return path to userspace, we still usually have to flush to get the user
to see the changes the kernel has made.
