This isn't a critical bug fix either.  I don't really care a whole
lot, since I don't plan to support ext4 with all of these patches but
if you haven't been doing a full set of testing with these patches,
I'd be very concerned about whether ext4 would be stable after
applying this patch series.

What sort of testing _have_ you done?
