Al was in the To: list of all 7 patches.

The maintainers (ext4/ext2/vfat) were also in the To: list.

Trouble is, MAINTAINERS says this:

MEMORY MANAGEMENT
L:      linux-mm@kvack.org
W:      http://www.linux-mm.org
S:      Maintained
F:      include/linux/mm.h
F:      mm/

There's a list, but no specific contact person.  That's why I had to start
asking around about who actually pushes mm changes to Linus.

As for Al Viro, he's still listed as the VFS maintainer; isn't he resting?
I guess he did nominate you for the holding off of morons (like me). :)
