Have you observed any real benefit from this feature?

Currently, disks will not be runtime-suspended unless (1) the user 
requests it by setting the appropriate power/control attribute, and (2) 
the device file is closed (in particular, the disk has no mounted 
filesystems or swap partitions).  I don't imagine this combination of 
events is very common for disks using libata.
