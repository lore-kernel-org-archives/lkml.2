It's important to note that I'm only proposing to wrap syscalls this
way that take a pathname argument. We can't do anything about those
that don't since at that point we have no way to retry the lookup.

So, I'm not sure this patch would affect the case you're concerned
about one way or another. If you move the file to a different
directory, then it's pathname would also change, and at that point
you'd end up with an ENOENT error or something on the next retry.

If the file was open and you were (for instance) reading or writing to
it from a client when you moved it, then we can't retry the lookup at
that point. The open is long since done and the pathname is now gone.
You'll get an ESTALE back in userspace regardless.

That sounds like a broken cluster configuration. Still...

Presumably at some point in the future, a sysadmin would intervene and
fix the situation such that /scratch is available again. Is it better
to return an error to the application at that point, or simply allow it
to keep retrying until the problem has been fixed?

The person with the long running job that's doing operations
in /scratch would probably prefer the latter. If not, then they could
always send the program a fatal signal to stop it altogether.
