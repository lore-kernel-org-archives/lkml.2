Reading your email I had to wonder the same thing... What application 
removes hierarchy of directories in a loop from two different clients?
I would suspect not many, if any... esp over NFS...

The amount of looping would be peer speculation. If the problem can
not be handled by one simple retry I would say we simply pass the
error up to the app... Its an application issue...

Introducing a new errno to handle this problem would be overkill IMHO...

If we have to go to the looping approach, I would strong suggest we
make the file systems register for this type of behavior...
