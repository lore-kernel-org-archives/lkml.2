In the patch description, you mentioned that this occurs when the
there is a failure to obtain a journal handle.  Is this a hypothetical
thing that you exposed via some kind of tester which checks to see
what happens if kmalloc() randomly fails some number of allocation
requests?  Or was it happening in real life?  And if it is happening
in real life, do we understand why it's happening, and is there
something we should be doing to mitigate against the root cause of the
failure?

The alternative to your patch is to do something similar to what ext3
does.  That is, if there are any inodes left on the orphan list, to
iterate through them all and then clean up the orphan list.  Perhaps
we should then also call ext4_error() since technically the file
system may very well be inconsistent (there may be allocated inodes
holding blocks which are no longer connected the directory hierarchy,
which e2fsck would be able to clean up).  But that could potentially
cause the system to panic or remount the file system read-only,
depending on what the errors= behavior is set to.  Which is why I go
back to the original question; do we understand why ext4_truncate()
was failing during orphan cleanup in the first place?
