I'm sorry it looked like I didn't test the patch, but I really didn't
face to any breakage (top, ps, gnome monitor).  The actual problem is
that the patch is still incomplete - all proc monitoring tools watch for
/proc/$PID/stat file content changes, not /proc/$PID/sched.
/proc/$PID/stat contains the same sched information, which I've missed.
Restricting "stat" does break these tools.

/proc/$PID/stat already has "fake" fields like KSTK_EIP() and KSTK_ESP().
We can continue to do such sort of force fields zeroing, which doesn't
break ABI.


Thanks,
