Again: I don't think this is the right approach in the long term.
It would be better not to add this interface and instead enable the
cpu cgroup subsystem for non-rt tasks using a similar duty ratio
concept..

Nevertheless, I've added some feedback on the code for you here :).

So most of the time I've been reviewing this I managed to invert it!
I imagined "duty" meant the tasks were "on duty" ie runnable ie thawed.
But according this this documentation it's the opposite...

I've reviewed my review and now my comments are consistent with the
above. :) However it makes me wonder if there are better names which
would avoid this confusion.

I'd rather see you merge these two structures -- I don't see the value
of keeping them separate nor of packing the struct. You could also merge
the work item in there:

struct freezer_duty {
	struct delayed_work freezer_work; /* work to duty-cycle a cgroup */

	u32 ratio; /* percentage of time frozen */
	u32 period_pct_ms; /* one percent of the period in miliseconds */
	unsigned int enabled:1;
	unsigned int freeze_thaw:1; /* 1: freeze 0: thaw */
};

(I'm going to make the rest of my comments without assuming you've done
this because it'll make them easier to follow given the context)

Looking better. There are alot of field accesses here which can race
with writes to the cgroup's duty ratio and period files. They should be
protected. Perhaps we can reuse the freezer spin lock. That also
has the benefit that we can eliminate the toggle.freeze_thaw bit I
think:

spin_lock(&freezer->lock);

This looks wrong. We should never schedule freezer work delayed by 0
jiffies -- even if the delayed work API allows it. With 0-length delays
I'd worry that we could peg the CPU in an obscure infinite loop.

I think you can safely eliminate this block and the "exit_toggle" label.

__freezer_change_state(freezer->css.cgroup, goal_state);
spin_unlock(&freezer->lock);

(where the __freezer_change_state() function expects to already have the
freezer lock -- you can make that your first patch and this your second)

But you ought to double check the lock ordering, may-sleep, and whether
the _irq variants are correct.

This looks wrong. It looks like there could be a race between the next
scheduled work and the toggling of the freeze_thaw value. This race
would cause the cgroup to miss one or more duty cycles. You'd have
to re-order these two lines and probably need an smp barrier of one
sort or another between them.

Of course if you use locking and eliminate the toggle.freeze_thaw field
as I've suggested then you can ignore this.

If duty.ratio is 100 then the delayed work should be cancelled too.
In fact it doesn't matter what the duty.ratio or period_pct_ms are --
writes to this file should always disable the duty cycle. Thus
you can omit the above if () and do this:

> +		if (freezer->toggle.enabled)

						{

> +			cancel_delayed_work_sync(&freezer->freezer_work);
> +		freezer->duty.ratio = 0;

Actually, shouldn't this be 0 if the cgroup is going to be thawed and
100 if it's going to be frozen?

> +		freezer->duty.period_pct_ms = 0;

I think this should always be a non-zero value -- even when duty
cycling is disabled. Perhaps:

		freezer->duty.period_pct_ms = 1000/100;

So it's clear the default period is 1000ms and one percent of it is 10ms.

(NOTE: To make it always non-zero you also need to add one line to the
cgroup initialization code in freezer_create()).

> +		freezer->toggle.enabled = 0;
> +		pr_info("freezer state changed by user, stop duty ratio\n");

nit: I don't think this pr_info() is terribly useful.

Because the delayed work function does not lock the cgroup this whole
function can race with the delayed work. So we need to be careful about how
we set/test all of these new fields -- we probably want to reuse the
freezer state lock for this so I've sprinkled some lock/unlock bits with
my comments below.

ratio == 100 ought to be allowed too.

Add:

		spin_lock_irq(&freezer->lock);

> +		freezer->duty.ratio = val;

Because this can race with the delayed work.

> +		break;

> +		do_div(val, 100);

This can race with the delayed work. Also I think that a 0ms period_pct_ms
should be disallowed. Otherwise all the work delays go to zero and we'll
probably peg the CPU so that it's just spinning the freezer state between
FROZEN and THAWED and doing nothing else.

Finally, I wonder if a 64-bit value is really necessary -- is a period
longer than roughly 50 days really necessary?

In summary, couldn't you just do something like:

		if ((val < 100) || (val > UINT_MAX)) {
			/* Too much time or may have rounded down to 0 */
			ret = -EINVAL;
			goto exit;
		}
		val = (unsigned int)val / 100;
		spin_lock_irq(&freezer->lock);
		freezer->duty.period_pct_ms = val;

I don't think this is as readable as (assuming the change above to disallow
setting period_pct_ms to 0):

	if (freezer->duty.ratio == 100) {
		freezer_disable_duty_cycling(freezer); /* see helper below */
		__freezer_change_state(freezer->css.cgroup, CGROUP_FROZEN);
	} else if (freezer->duty.ratio == 0) {
		freezer_disable_duty_cycling(freezer);
		__freezer_change_state(freezer->css.cgroup, CGROUP_THAWED);
	} else {
		if (freezer->toggle.enabled)
			goto exit; /* Already enabled */
		INIT_DELAYED_WORK(&freezer->freezer_work, freezer_work_fn);
		freezer->toggle.enabled = 1;
		schedule_delayed_work(&freezer->freezer_work, 0);
	}
	spin_unlock_irq(&freezer->lock);

Where the helper is:

static void freezer_disable_duty_cycling(struct freezer *freezer)
{
	if (freezer->toggle.enabled) {
		cancel_delayed_work_sync(&freezer->freezer_work);
		freezer->toggle.enabled = 0;
	}
}

which could also be called from freezer_write() I think.
