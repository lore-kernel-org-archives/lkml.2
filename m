It doesn't know what consequences suspending a host controller
has for the devices attached to it. It simply cannot know because
that depends on the hardware.

A very good example is the media change problem of the media readers.
For example an iSCSI virtual host controller can suspend while a command
is in flight if the network controller used can do remote wakeup well enough.

Yes.

They know some reasons to not suspend, but not all reasons.

The storage device == a USB device that implements the storage class
the disk == a SCSI disk drive

Yes, we can use the same heuristics as everywhere.
command queued -> autopm_get
command finished -> autopm_put

but for the USB host adapter, not the sr device

No. This problem goes away if you correctly make the distinction between
host controller/storage device and the disk drive.
You use the "active command standard" for the host controller.
Then you need not care about the commands needed to suspend a disk drive.
You cannot suspend the host controller while the disk drive is being suspended
anyway, as the tree constraint prevents it.

For the disk drive you just declare them busy restarting the timeout as a command
goes down to the hardware. There is an interesting case about what you do if
the generic layer wants to autosuspend an sr device which has a command queued.
I propose we catch that case in sr_suspend() and return -EBUSY in
the autosuspend with command in flight case.

And I admit we will need to special case the stupid card readers.
