Oleg, I hope that you realize that we all appreciate your efforts to solve

Hopefully this is not much in alloc_pidmap() since we can expect that nr_pi=
ds
and last_pid are in the same cache line.

I presume that you wanted to say upid->ns.

This patch itself does not look wrong to me.

This last point is what made me worry about your approach so far, although =
I did
not take time to spot the precise issues. Unfortunately I don't see what the
checks you added in proc_self_readlink(), proc_self_follow_link() and
proc_pid_lookup() buy. What does prevent destroy_pid_namespace() from runni=
ng
concurrently? Maybe RCU could help in those cases?

Moreover, I think that proc_pid_readdir() should get some check too.

So what make me really worry about this approach is that it looks fragile. =
We
should find all locations where procfs expects that sb->s_fs_info is a vali=
d pid
namespace, even if no more pids live in this namespace. I presume that this=
 is
what you did, but this needs double-check at least.

Grepping for s_fs_info in fs/proc gives me:

- proc_test_super(), proc_set_super():
  Ok because tasks only mount procfs of their active pid namespace.

- proc_kill_sb():
  Your patch makes it ok.

- proc_single_show():
  Ok because a pid must be alive to get here.

- proc_self_readlink(), proc_self_follow_link(), proc_pid_lookup():
  Your patch could make them ok, provided that we protect against
  destroy_pid_namespace()->kmem_cache_free().

- proc_pid_readdir():
  Needs similar check and protection to proc_pid_lookup(), but there is ano=
ther
  issue: next_tgid() can find a dying task:

  next_tgid() finds a task
                                   task dies
                                   last reference to ns is dropped
                                   destroy_pid_namespace()

  proc_pid_readdir()
  ->proc_pid_fill_cache()
    ->proc_fill_cache()
      ->proc_pid_instantiate()
        ->proc_pid_make_inode()
          ->new_inode()
            ->alloc_inode()
              ->kmem_cache_alloc(, GFP_KERNEL) blocks

  So RCU would not be sufficient to protect proc_pid_readdir(). We could ma=
ke
  pid_ns_release_proc() lock root inode's mutex before clearing s_fs_info:

    void pid_ns_release_proc(struct pid_namespace *ns)
    {
	struct inode *root_inode;

	if (ns->proc_mnt) {
		root_inode =3D ns->proc_mnt->mnt_sb->s_root->d_inode;

		mutex_lock(&root_inode->i_mutex);
		ns->proc_mnt->mnt_sb->s_fs_info =3D NULL;
		PROC_I(root_inode)->pid =3D NULL;
		mutex_unlock(&root_inode->i_mutex);

		mntput(ns->proc_mnt);
	}
    }

  This would also solve the issue for proc_pid_lookup() btw.

- proc_task_lookup(), proc_task_readdir():
  Ok, because a pid is pinned by dir.

However, I don't think that I'm trustable enough to validate all of this.
Waiting for Eric's comments at least.

Again, thanks a lot Oleg!
