The idr_pre_get() kerneldoc is wrong.  Or at least, misleading.

The way this all works is that we precharge the tree via idr_pre_get()
and we do this outside locks so we can use GFP_KERNEL.  Then we take
the lock (a spinlock!) and then try to add an element to the tree,
which will consume objects from the pool which was prefilled by
idr_pre_get().

There's an obvious race here where someone else can get in and steal
objects from the prefilled pool.  We can fix that with a retry loop:


again:
	if (idr_pre_get(..., GFP_KERNEL) == NULL)
		return -ENOMEM;		/* We're really out-of-memory */
	spin_lock(lock);
	if (idr_get_new(...) == -EAGAIN) {
		spin_unlock(lock);
		goto again;		/* Someone stole our preallocation! */
	}
	...

this way we avoid the false -ENOMEM which the race would have caused. 
We only declare -ENOMEM when we're REALLY out of memory.


But none of this is needed when a sleeping lock is used (as long as the
sleeping lock isn't taken on the the VM pageout path, of course).  In
that case we can use the sleeping lock to prevent the above race.

So the old code was OK.

The new code, however, is not OK because it is vulnerable to the above
race wherein another CPU or thread comes in and steals all of this
thread's preallocation.
