That's correct, it was committed directly by Linus.

Pretty much it is.

The code snippet is slightly out of context and it is a part of the
software_resume() routine, which is only called when the kernel's built-in
image reading code checks whether or not the image is present.  It won't
work anyway if SCSI is not built in.
