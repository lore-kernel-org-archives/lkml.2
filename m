I think the general expectation in the protocol is that there are no
hard linked directories. This assumption is reflected in the fact that
we have operations such as LOOKUPP (the NFSv4 equivalent of
lookup("..")) which only take a filehandle argument.

See commit ce587e07ba2e25b5c9d286849885b82676661f3e (NFS: Prevent the
mount code from looping forever on broken exports) which was just
merged. It prevents nesting > 2 levels deep (ignore the changelog
comment about MAX_NESTED_LINKS - that is a typo).
