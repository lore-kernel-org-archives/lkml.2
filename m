If I freeze w/ anything in the log, then s_start !=0 and we proceed
normally.  If I re-freeze w/o anything in the log, it's already set to
FLUSHED (which makes sense) so not re-setting it doesn't matter.  So I
don't see that that's an issue.

As for FIBMAP I think we only do journal_flush if it's data=journal.

In other news, Phoronix is on the case, so expect escalating freakouts ;)
