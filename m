Well, I believe we were over-optimistic in claiming that we don't need this
syscall (to be fair I think we simply yet not faced the problem Eric points).
So we need some way to fetch this address and set it back. If get_robust_list
get deprecated maybe we could print it out in /proc/pid/stat or something?
