But that exactly the issue that the filesystem .freeze_fs
method is supposed to handle.  It's supposed to finish the
freeze process by finishing all outstanding metadata operations and
cleaning all remaining dirty metadata. It still has to guarantee
this regardless of the model used prior to this.

If the changes are already in the journal, then there is no new
transaction work needed to clean the VFS state.  Indeed, .freezefs
needs to write back all dirty metadata objects that it is tracking
internally in the journal so that a snapshot of the frozen image is
consistent and can be mounted read-only without running recovery...

Most definitely. It means that we have to have freeze behaviour in
mind whether doing any async/background work. That's usually the
furthest think from people's minds when implementing stuff like
background inode initialisation...

Might be nasty? There's no question about it in my mind that it
*would* be nasty....

Not really. It needs to be done on rw filesytems[*].

Besides, this isn't really an XFS specific problem - the shrinkers
need to operate on frozen filesystems. e.g. run a directory
traversal of a frozen filesystem, and if you stop the shrinkers from
running then the dcache/icache growth will run the system out of
memory.

Sure, blocking a shrinker can be considered antisocial, but if you
can't free memory because it will dirty inodes on a frozen
filesystem then it is better to block the shrinker until the
filesytem is unfrozen than it is to allow the shrinker to fail and
eventually OOM the machine. Freezing filesysetms is supposed to be a
short term, workload-invisible operation. Kicking the OOM killer
because you can't free inodes is far more antisocial than having
those applications pause while the fs is frozen.

[*] Right now we are discussing adding a new background/async worker
that that does speculative preallocation removal to make it occur
faster than it currently does. So skipping it is not really an
option and this is exactly the sort of "new feature needs to
consider how to deal with freeze" problem I'm talking about.

An additional percpu counter is far, far cheaper than the cost of
always needing to consider how not to break filesystem freezing for
the forseeable future.

Sure - that's to ensure the log is dirty so that open-but-unlinked
inodes are handled correctly by recovery if the system crashes while the
filesystem is frozen. But the last patch in your series would prevent
freezing filesystems while there are open-but-unlinked files
present, so all that grot could be removed.

Indeed, when that patch goes to mainline, the XFS code for
handling remount,ro and freeze can be made identical....

The only additional infrastructure that you need to provide is a
"start_nested" operation for xfs_trans_dup() that increments the
percpu counter. I don't think that's a difficult problem to solve.

Dave.
