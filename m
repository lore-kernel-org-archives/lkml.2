In this case regular queue idle is hitting and not group idle. So some
kind of think time stats probably might be useful for group idle check
but not necessarily for queue idle.

Secondly, for this case think time will change. If you stop idling on
fsync and jbd threads, both will be dispatching IOs fast and both will
have small thinktime. We will think that thinktime is small so we
will enable idle. Then there think time will increase as both will
get blocked behind each other. And then we will removing idling. So
looks like we will be oscillating between enabling and disabling
think time.

If we don't allow idling on sync-no-idle queues, then basic CFQ will
be broken.

Actually in your statement there are multiple suggestions and I might
have actually missed the gist of it.

Thanks
Vivek
