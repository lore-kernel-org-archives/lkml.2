Only depending on block device capacity. Once at the maximum AG size
(1TB), mkfs has to add more AGs. So once above 4TB for hardware RAID
LUNs and 16TB for md/dm devices, you will get an AG per TB of
storage by default.

As it is, the optimal number and size of AGs will depend on many
geometry factors as workload factors, such as the size of the luns,
the way they are striped, whether you are using linear concatenation
of luns or striping them or a combination of both, the amount of
allocation concurrency you require, etc. In these sorts of
situations, mkfs can only make a best guess - to do better you
really need someone proficient in the dark arts to configure the
storage and filesystem optimally.

mkfs.xfs can get the information it needs directly from dm and md
devices. However, when hardware RAID luns present themselves to the
OS in an identical manner to single drives, how does mkfs tell the
difference between a 2TB hardware RAID lun made up of 30x73GB drives
and a single 2TB SATA drive? The person running mkfs should already
know this little detail....

If your hardware procurement-to-production process doesn't include
testing performance of potential equipment on a representative
workload, then I'd say you have a process problem that we can't help
you solve....

> Saying that you should

I never test every option. I know what the options do, so to decide
what to tweak (if anything) what I first need to know is how a
workload performs on a given storage layout with default options. I
need to have:

	a) some idea of the expected performance of the workload
	b) a baseline performance characterisation of the underlying
	   block devices
	c) a set of baseline performance metrics from a
	   representative workload on a default filesystem
	d) spent some time analysing the baseline metrics for
	   evidence of sub-optimal performance characteristics.

Once I have that information, I can suggest meaningful ways (if any)
to change the storage and filesystem configuration that may improve
the performance of the workload.

BTW, if you ask me how to optimise an ext4 filesystem for the same
workload, I'll tell you straight up that I have no idea and that you
should ask an ext4 expert....

Well, yes, that is precisely the reason you should use the defaults.
It's also the reason we have experts - they know what knob to
twiddle to fix specific problems. If you prefer to twiddle knobs
like Blind Freddy, then you should expect things to go wrong....

Have you ever considered that this is exactly what mkfs does when
you use the defaults?  And that this is the fundamental reason we
keep saying "use the defaults"?

The thread has now come full circle - you're ranting about not
knowing what knobs do or how to set reasonable values so you want to
twiddle random knobs them to see if they do anything as the basis of
your optimisation process. This is the exact process that lead to
the bug report that started this thread - a tweak-without-
understanding configuration leading to undesirable behavioural
characteristics from the filesystem.....

Cheers,

Dave.
