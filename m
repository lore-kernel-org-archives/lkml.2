Oh, you didn't put a ->removable check in enough paths.  The setting on
UA was still unconditional, as was the check in sd_prep_fn().

The code can never really be merged.  for CD/DVD, UA pretty much does
mean medium removal.  Discs and arrays emit a panoply of UA events (it's
the SCSI asynchronous event mechanism) if you assume media change on all
of them, there'll be terrible confusion.  We can narrow to 28/00 that
means medium may have changed.  It could really do with checking by
someone who has a removable disc device, though ... it looks like some
of the 3B/xx might be applicable.

Thanks,
