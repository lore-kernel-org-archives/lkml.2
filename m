  Reallocated blocks - not really. For a block to be freed it cannot be
under writeback and when it's freed no writeback is started. For metadata -
yes. But ext3, ext4, xfs, btrfs have to avoid modifying metadata under
writeback anyway (because of journalling / COW constraints) and thus they
don't care. For ext2 or vfat it's a different story. But as I wrote to
Darrick, I'm not sure about vfat but for ext2 and similar legacy
filesystems, I'd rather let them live with their unstable pages under IO ;)
because I see a limited use for that.
