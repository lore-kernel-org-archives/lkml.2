Consider mtime.

I suspect it will be a performance disaster on x86 for VFS intensive
applications on capable file systems. VFS is very performance
critical. These checks lurk on unexpected places too, e.g. on /dev
access.

Even TSC is much slower than just reading the variable.

Also you should check if the file system granuality 
even supports it, it's completely wasted on a ext3 for example.

Maybe as a optional sysctl, default to off.
