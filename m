It also probably means that fanotify misses some events when a filesystem=
=20
is modified over NFS. If fanotify is used the way it is designed, i.e.=20
with an antiviruse software, this may be an interesting way to skip the=20
antiviruse check.

Here we go:

NFS server, run the fanotify example tool:

~/fanotify-example# ./fanotify -m /data/

NFS client, open a fd then do some I/O:

# exec 1> test
# ls -la
#=20

NFS server log:

/data/test: pid=3D1235 modify close(writable)

NFS server, cache clearing:

# echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches=20

NFS client, more I/O:

# ls -la

NFS server log:

/data: pid=3D1234 modify close(writable)

We receive an event... which is obviously wrong. This is even worse than=20
no event at all, we receive an event about the wrong inode, the parent=20
inode of the modified file actually.

This is what I am going to do, at least temporarily, I only need to=20
watch about a million file (and slowly counting).

The startup time to watch an entire filesystem using inotify already=20
require a full filesystem walk, watching all files and directories=20
instead of directories only will not change much because most of the=20
time is spent waiting I/O operations. This may however require a lot=20
more memory both on kernel side and userland side.

No clue, this should be checked but there is no evident reason that it=20
cannot be bypassed this way as well.

Yup, I agree.

No filepath and no filename at all actually. There is no way to find the=20
(or "a" if the file is linked to more than one directory) filename other=20
than walking among all the directory tree to find where the inode is=20
linked. We need a directory entry (dirent) to send an event about a=20
modified file inside a watched directory.

By doing that, we'll only get the inode nb as we cannot fetch the filename.
