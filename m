for async read done, it will call nfs_readpage_result -> nfs_read_done
-> nfs_refresh_inode -> nfs_refresh_inode_locked ->
nfs_inode_attrs_need_update -> nfs_size_need_update.

we need consider the situation that "async read_done also call
nfs_size_need_update with an old useless larger file size".

you means, it need not consider async read (only consider async write is
enough), is it correct ?

1) I have read the relative source code of 2.6.27-rc9, it is truly no
nfs_size_need_update function.

2) I have test the 2.6.27-rc9, it truly pass the LTP test of udp+nfsv2.

3) I got the 2.6.27-rc9 source code by this way (please check)
   A) get source code from (git clone)
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
   B) git archive v2.6.27-rc9 | tar -xf - -C ../2.6.27-rc9/

1) you means: in some condition, the cached file size can be bigger than
the true file size ?  can you give some example (which no negative
effect for correctness) ?

2) What I feel:
   A) I am not quite familiar with nfs (so truly need your information);
   B) I think it is truly a bug, but maybe nfs_size_need_update is not
the root cause (so need nfs maintainers' audit)
   C) if nfs_size_need_update is truly not the root cause, I shall
continue analysing it, after get enough information from nfs maintainers.

for udp + nfsv2 failing (I am not test udp + nfsv3)

truly got confirmation from Jeff Layton, 1-2 months ago;
also thank you for giving confirmation too.
