Bah. Technical arguments win here, not politics. Besides, what
possible political concern can anyone have about using a different
upstream tree for development? A storage maintainer tree would not
replace anyone's little fiefdom; what we need is an integration point
long before stuff gets to Linus....

If that's the barrier to discussion, then where else but a dedicated
storage workshop are you going to get a more representative sample
of storage developers in the same room?
