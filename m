I'm suggesting an enhancement.

The change is to use TCP for the NSM upcall transport, and set RPC_TASK_SOFTCONN on the individual RPCs.  The advantage of this is that the kernel could discover when statd is not running and fail the upcall immediately, rather than waiting possibly many seconds for each upcall RPC to time out.

The client already has a check in the mount.nfs command to see that statd is running, likely to avoid this lengthly timeout.  Since the client already has long-standing logic to avoid it, I think the benefit would be mostly on the server side.

But this change can be done at some later point.
