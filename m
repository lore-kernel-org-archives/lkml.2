Sorry, yes, at best I had a verbal OK from Al (and maybe I'm wrong about
that).  I got impatient.

Right.  By default it's 90 seconds before we'll give up on the client.

I hate that too, and originally tried to avoid it with something like:

	retry:
		acquire locks
		lookup inode
		ret = try_to_break_deleg(inode);
		if (ret)
			drop locks
			really_break_deleg(inode);
			goto retry;
		... do the real work ...
		drop locks

I felt like I was making already complicated code logic like rename's
even harder to follow.

And those operations don't really know the inode till they acquire the
locks, so in pathological cases that could continue forever.

No, I think you understand correctly.

The presence of a delegation requires blocking certain operations until
a client somewhere responds (or we time out).

So the question as I understand it is whether there's a way to lessen
the impact by blocking only what we really need to.

I don't know if there's a way to do that without reworking the vfs
directory locking to be much more fine-grained.
