Yeah, pull it.  I just talked this over with Vivek, and looking back at
the blktrace data I think I have another idea that might work and be
less invasive.

Basically, the iozone process is, umm, special.  It does the following
at startup (from memory, so I might've missed a step):

open(fd);
truncate(fd,0);
close(fd)
open(fd);
fsync(fd);

*then* it does I/O.

So, we get a sync cfqq for the iozone process that ends up doing the
metadata lookups.  Then it does the truncate and of course blocks.  At
this point, we are waiting for jbd2 to run to sync out its transaction.
However, we're idling on the iozone cfqq, so it doesn't get a chance to
run for 8ms.

If we instead just pass a hint down to the I/O scheduler on fsync,
similar to the schedule() call for the cpu scheduler, then I think we
can give up our time slice and allow the jbd2 process to run.

I'll report back with my findings.  Vivek, thanks a ton for the careful
(as always) review.

Cheers,
Jeff
