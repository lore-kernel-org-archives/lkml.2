I believe, that container is assuming to work in  it's own network and pid 
namespaces.
With your approach, if I'm not mistaken, container's /proc/net and /proc/sys 
tunables will be unaccessible from parent environment. Or I'm wrong here?

1) On one hand it looks logical, that any nested dentries in /proc are tied to 
pid namespace. But on the other hand we have a lot of tunables in /proc/net, 
/proc/sys, etc. which have nothing with processes or whatever similar.
2) currently /proc processes directories (i.e. /proc/1/, etc) depends on mount 
maker context. But /proc/sys and /proc/net doesn't. This looks weird and 
despondently, from my pow. What do you think about it?

And what do you think about "conteinerization" of /proc contents in the way like 
"sysfs" was done?
Implementing /proc "conteinerization" in this way can give us great flexibility.
For example, /proc/net (and /proc/sys/sunrpc) depends on mount owner net 
namespace, /proc/sysvipc depends on mount owner ipc namespace, etc.
And this approach doesn't break backward compatibility as well.
