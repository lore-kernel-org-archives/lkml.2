True, that's not nice.

I wanted to put it early on in the unmount path so that the shrinker
was guaranteed to be gone before evict_inodes() was called. That
would mean that it is obviously safe to remove the iprune_sem
serialisation in that function.

The code in the umount path is quite different between 2.6.35 (the
original version of the patchset) and 3.0-rc1, so I'm not surprised
that I haven't put the unregister call in the right place.

Agreed. In trying to find the best "early" place to unregister the
shrinker, I've completely missed the obvious "late is safe"
solution. I'll respin it with these changes.

Cheers,

Dave.
