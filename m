Well, could somebody eventually explain what are advantages of LIO over
SCST so you are choosing it?

LIO is obviously worse all technically (see
http://scst.sourceforge.net/comparison.html) as well as in the number of
users and size of the community. Current in-rush attempts to make LIO
_look_ not worse than SCST changed nothing in this area.

In the resent threads how many people voted for LIO? Nobody. How many
for SCST? Many. Moreover, has any real user of LIO participated in those
threads? None?

Doesn't that matter for you? Which code is the best doesn't matter for
Linux anymore?

Undercover games are going on?
