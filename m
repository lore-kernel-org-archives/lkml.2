Great!

And that's appreciated. I included it to make sure everyone could
see how this all fitted together and others could test it if they so
desired. i.e. make sure I wasn't breaking ext4 by reverting the
changes to write_cache_pages. I'll leave it in the series until the
ext4 change is upstream, then I'll drop it.

Cheers,

Dave.
