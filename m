Sorry... I misunderstood you.

In cases like the above, then the default behaviour of the server would
be to assign the same filehandles to those mount points. The
administrator can, however, make them different by choosing to use the
'fsid' mount option to manually assign different fsids to the different
export points.

If not, then the client will automatically group these things in the
same superblock, so like the server, it too is supposed to share the
same inode for these different objects. It will then use
d_obtain_alias() to get a root dentry for that inode (see
nfs4_get_root()).

Cheers
