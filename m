That's no problem, thanks for looking.

For the inode dirty bit race problem, yes it should fix it.
sync_inode_metadata basically makes the same checks without
races (in a subsequent patch I re-introduced the datasync
optimisation).

Well in your fsync, you need to wait for inode writeback
that might have been started by an asynchronous write_inode.

Also, with your sync_inode_metadata call, you shouldn't need the
sync_inode call by the looks.

At this point I'd just like some review and feedback, we
might get some other opinions on how to fix it, so don't
take the changes quite yet.

I'll cc you again with a broken out patch.

Thanks,
