How? All that seccomp can do is deny system calls and kill the task.
What you describe sounds more like ptrace.

Seccomp can't change system calls, only prevent them, so I miss how it
can change anything for UML in that way.

Well, obviously it will use seccomp filters instead of ptrace when possible
and do the more complicated stuff via PTRACE_SECCOMP_EVENT when seccomp isn't
sufficient. But mainly for performance reasons.

"process is traceable" should be "process is able to trace".
