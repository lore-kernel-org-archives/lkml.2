It's simple cp -a Jenkins{,.bak} so dir to dir copy on same volume.

IMO the problem is not - only - in read speed. The directory order hit
here. There's a difference in the sequential tests that place btrfs as
the winner but still this should not have that huge influence on
getdents. I know a bit on the difference between ext4 and btrfs
directory handling and I would not expect that huge difference. On the
production system where the issue has been observed doing some real
work in the background copy takes up to 4h.

For me btrfs looks perfect here, what could be worth checking is the
change of timing in syscall between 39.4 and 3.2.7. Before getdents
was not that high on the list while now it jumps to second position
but without huge impact on the timings.

Will check this still today and report back.
