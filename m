You're still missing the point - that this isn't an XFS specific
problem or that the write problem is a ext4 specific problem. The
problem is that these are freeze state transition problems -
something that can affect every filesystem because the freeze code
is generic.  Quite frankly, I'm not interested in having a generic
solution for SB_FREEZE_WRITE and a custom, per filesystem solution
for SB_FREEZE_TRANS when the solution is exactly the same.

So, like Eric said in his first email, it's not a "write start/end"
interface that is needed, the interface has to work with different
freeze levels (e.g "sb_freeze_ref(sb, level)/sb_freeze_drop(sb,
level)").  Sure, internally it would have to map to two counters and
different level checks, but it solves the same problem for all
levels of freeze for all filesystems.

Let's fix this freeze problem once and for all in the generic code,
and not have to keep coming back to it to add more functioanlity for
different situations the most recent fix didn't handle for random
filesystem X....

Eric and I have already discussed and agreed to replacing the XFS
sepcific code with the fixed VFS level API where other XFS
developers including the "XFS Maintainers" (*) can see. Nobody has
objected so I doubt there's any problem with doing so.

Besides, anything that replaces custom XFS code with a better
generic solution is pretty much guaranteed to be done. And given
that this is not an XFS specifc problem and it needs be fixed at
the VFS level.....

Cheers,

Dave.

[*] keep in mind that "XFS Maintainer" is just a figurehead who
maintains the tree that is sent to Linus, not the person with final
say over what changes are made. That decision is made by the
reviewers of the code...
