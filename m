Honestly I don't know either way, but it seemed a shame to give up a
common and trivial optimization.

That won't hurt.  I think 1-100 then 1000-1100 may actually be more
representative.  Not that I would mind seeing the larger range.
Especially since I am in the process of encouraging the use of more
uids.

Yes.  A small emperical test sounds good.
