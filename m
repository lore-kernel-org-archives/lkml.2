Let me rephrase :)  The current behavior makes sense for an inwardly
focused system. seccomp mode=1 and mode=2 are about the behavior of
the task they apply to.  In that regard, both modes block (or can
block) ptrace, which means that there is no way for them to exploit
this -- they are operating correctly.

The discussion we're having now is if that is the desirable behavior.
Do we want seccomp to be a system call contract between userspace and
the kernel for the task no matter what, or do we want it to be a
system call contract between the specific task's code and the kernel
(thereby allowing a tracer to make things act totally differently).
