Turns out priv=0 was never actually being established in get_request()
on the kernel I was testing (see below).

That backtrace was from a RHEL6 port of your recent flush merge work.
One RHELism associated with the RHEL6 flush+fua port in general (and now
this flush merge port) is that bio and request flags are _not_ shared.

As such I introduced BIO_FLUSH and BIO_FUA flags in RHEL6.  Long story
short, my 4/3 patch works just fine ontop of your 3 patches that Jens
just staged for 2.6.39.

So sorry for the noise!  I'm kicking myself for having tainted my patch
(and your work indirectly) by making an issue out of nothing.

Taking a step back, what do you think of my proposed patch?

Mike
