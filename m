You probably need to do a gpg --refresh

I use the subkeys method for signing, so I have my master key (which
expires in 2016) in one of Greg's GPG devices, but I have signing and an
encryption subkeys which are short lived (currently expire in Oct 2012).
If you do a gpg --list-keys 'James Bottomley' you'll see this:

pub   2048R/214854D6 2011-09-23 [expires: 2016-09-27]
uid                  James Bottomley
<James.Bottomley@HansenPartnership.com>
uid                  James Bottomley <JBottomley@Parallels.com>
uid                  James Bottomley <jejb@kernel.org>
uid                  [jpeg image of size 5254]
sub   2048R/0D77E313 2011-09-23 [expires: 2012-10-25]
sub   2048R/2C5CBD0C 2011-10-27 [expires: 2012-10-25]

The 2048R/2C5CBD0C is my signature one.  I have to update the expiry of
them every six months, so you probably haven't done a refresh since I
did the update.

I do it this way so that I don't have to carry my master key with me
when travelling (or if I do, I don't have to use it except for signing
other keys, since the GPG devices are a bit cumbersome), so if something
goes wrong, I can revoke my subkey and just generate a new one (without
having to get everyone's signature again).

Hope the above helps (would rather not have had to become a gpg advanced
user, but there you go ...)
