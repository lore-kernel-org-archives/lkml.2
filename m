Surprised noone else ever hit this, it's been broken for a LONG time. In
any case I'll have this in the next time he pushes a -next.

commit bf770d242d100882891ac60e42f2cf0096fc3f3c

    fsnotify: add iput on inodes when no longer marked
    
    fsnotify takes an igrab on an inode when it adds a mark.  The code was
    supposed to drop the reference when the mark was removed.  The problem
    was that what actually happened was below
    
    void fsnotify_destroy_inode_mark(struct fsnotify_mark *mark)
    {
    	...
    	mark->inode = NULL;
    	...
    }
    
    void fsnotify_destroy_mark(struct fsnotify_mark *mark)
    {
    	struct inode *inode = NULL;
    	...
    	if (mark->flags & FSNOTIFY_MARK_FLAG_INODE) {
    		fsnotify_destroy_inode_mark(mark);
    		inode = mark->i.inode;
    	}
    	...
    	if (inode)
    		iput(inode);
    	...
    }
    
    Obviously the intent was to capture the inode before it was set to NULL in
    fsnotify_destory_inode_mark().
