That's fine, _BUT_ you are trying to go around the rules for the merge
window, which isn't acceptable.  Also note that your driver isn't
self-contained, it needs this change at the least, right?  Any others?

No, sorry, I'll not take this for .40, all of my trees are merged with
Linus now for .40 and I'll only be sending him bugfixes until the .41
merge window opens up.

Remember, it's only a 3 month wait, you knew about this _WAY_ in
advance, so it's not like this is something new, or out of the ordinary
at all.  Because of that, I fail to see why this is somehow not
expected.

On a personal note, I'm going to be very scarse for the next 3 weeks due
to conferences and travel for spring break, so I physically don't have
the time to do any more merges like this with Linus.

thanks,
