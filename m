Ok, I know that.
I know, that if some task with pid N is in other network namespace, then 
/proc/<N>/net contents will differ to /proc/selt/net contents.

Ok. But this approach still requires some additional data to manage in user 
space. I.e. it's really easy to manage container's context using it's fs root, 
because container's root is a part of initial configuration. But container's 
processed pids numbers in parent context are unpredictable.

/proc/net is a part or /proc. And /proc mount is called per container. So this 
is just like it is.

I have some solution I mind, which looks quite simple to implement, doesn't 
require significant additional state to manage and suits my needs.
Please, consider this.
It's based on sysfs containerization approach, but simplified a lot.
Sysctl's (comparing to sysfs entries) entries are the same for all namespaces.
This actually means, that we don't need any additional infrastructure for 
managing dentries. All we need to know on read/write operations with sysctl's is 
the namespaces /proc was mounted from.

Thus if we:

1) replace /proc sb->s_fsdata content from pid_namespace to nsproxy and
2) add link to /proc sb to ctl_table and
3) add ns tag (pid, net, else or none) to ctl_table

then we will have all we need to manage sysctl's content in the way we want.
And looks like this approach doesn't break backward compatibility.

What do you think about it?
