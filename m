I don't see how this is relevant.  We're talking about suspending the
drive, not suspending the host adapter.  Runtime PM for an iSCSI host
adapter can be implemented to suspend in the middle of commands if it
wants; that has no bearing on this discussion and patch set.

So the lower layers can do their own autopm_get when necessary.

And in the case of some other sort of SCSI transport, I suppose "the 
storage device" includes the host adapter or equivalent.

Didn't we discuss this a long time ago and decide it was a bad 
approach?

Heh, you're talking about ignoring the tree constraint anyway if you're 
going to suspend the USB device while the children beneath it remain 
unchanged.
