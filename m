Your change to grab_cache_page_write_begin looks good to me, at least
for ext4.  For ext3 you have to actually go in and wait for each of the
buffer heads in the page, since ext3 (and reiserfs) will write the buffer heads
directly without using writepage.

Have you confirmed by looking at the block mapping that your crc errors
are from data blocks?
