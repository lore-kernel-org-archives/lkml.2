Yes, these two issues have pending fixes that are posted to linux-scsi:

Hotplug lifetime rules are still transport specific.  So in this case
scsi-core is innocent these are bugs from libsas and
scsi_transport_sas.

This patch doesn't really paper over anything.  It turns a NULL
pointer crash into an explicit warning from kobject_add_internal.  For
the libsas/scsi case this device_add() failure is still fatal.
Regardless of whether sysfs changes the above two fixes are still
required.

Since the -EEXIST case is just a KERN_ERR and not a BUG_ON I figured
it was worthwhile to post a patch to do the same for this 'parent
deleted' case.  But if crashing is the expectation then this patch can
be dropped.
