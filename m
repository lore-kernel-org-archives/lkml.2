I actually received 3+ off-post emails asking whether I was talking
about initiator or target in the 100K IOPS case below and what did I
mean by the ACKs.
I was referring to the 'Initiator' side.
ACKs == When scsi-ML down-calls the LLD via the queue-command, process
the sgl's(if you like) and then trigger the scsi_done up-call path.
