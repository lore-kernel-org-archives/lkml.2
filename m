I was thinking more of stuff that's already in the Linux stat struct, some of
which is fabricated because the underlying fs doesn't support it.

Take RomFS for example: it fabricates all of st_mtime, st_atime, st_ctime,
st_nlinks, st_blocks, st_uid and st_gid because none of them are stored in the
medium

Similarly, UbiFS fabricates st_blocks and complains in a comment that it makes
no sense for that type of filesystem.

There are other examples.
