I was hoping that if the killall logic never set anything that was also
set by the work-queue thread it would be lock-safe without needing
explicit locking.

I was a bit concerned that my flags |= KILLME logic would potentially
over-write flags that were being simultaneously written elsewhere
(so maybe I'd have to add a completely new variable for that KILLME flag
to really be safe.)

I think it still races..more comments below.

I think the race still exists, though it would be harder to hit.
What if the killall logic sets task->tk_callback right after you assign do_action, but before
you set tk_callback to NULL?  Or after you set tk_callback to NULL for
that matter.
