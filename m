It has always been marked experimental in 2.6.27, not stable so I'm
totally lost about this effort.

See http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.27.47/fs/Kconfig

 145          Ext4dev is a predecessor filesystem of the next generation
 146          extended fs ext4, based on ext3 filesystem code. It will be
 147          renamed ext4 fs later, once ext4dev is mature and stabilized.
