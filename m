Ah, sorry, I didn't see this message when I responded to your earlier
message (you didn't mail thread it).  I also didn't recall your
earlier complaint until I did an search of my mail archives.

The main problem is that we don't have an easy reproduction case.
It's not a problem which has been showing up on any of my testing.
Earlier you had said that this happened after a read-only snapshot, so
I had assumed it was an DM issue.

But you say this time it's not happening without a snapshot.  OK, how
frequently does this happen?  How easily can you reproduce it?  Can
you do it pretty much on demand?  And are the numbers *always* the same?

Can you run this command instead? e2fsck -f /dev/XXXX

And send me the output?  The -p overrides the -f option, so it wasn't
doing a full fsck check.  It should have done a full check if the file
system was marked as containing an error, regardless of the -p, but
there was a bug that was fixed in 3.5-rc1 which prevented that.  I'm
at a loss to explain why you were still seeing problem in 3.5-rc1 ---
was the fsck log from after running a kernel running 3.5-rc1?  In any
case, please do a full fsck using "e2fsck -f /dev/XXX" and send me the
output from that command.

Regards,
