The issue here happens only with reads.

And sometimes -- speaking only from the behavour I've seen, not from the
actual frames sent -- server does not respond to the RENEW too, in which
case the client reports "nfs server no responding", and on the next
renew it may actually respond.  This happens too, but much more rare.

During these stalls, ie, when there's no network activity at all,
the server NFSD threads are busy eating all available CPU.

What does it all tell us? :)

Thank you!
