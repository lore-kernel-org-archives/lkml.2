Because Arnd Bergmann is working on a set of patches that makes sparse
complain if you access an RCU-protected pointer directly, without using
some flavor of rcu_dereference().

So your approach would work for the moment, but would need another
change, probably in the 2.6.35 timeframe.

I must defer to Trond on this one.
