That sounds a lot better than renaming/moving the file.

Yes. This would require some education. But new attributes have been
added in the past (e.g. immutable) that caused confusion to users and
tools that didn't know about them.

EIO sounds wrong ... but it is perhaps the best of the existing codes. Adding
a new one is also challenging too.

This is pretty much a given. Nobody will see the message in the console log
until it is far too late.

18 years ago Intel rather famously attempted to sell users on the idea that a
rare divide error that sometimes gave the wrong answer could be ignored. Before
my time at Intel, but it is still burned into the corporate psyche that customers
really don't like to get the wrong answers from their computers.

Whether it is worth it may depend on the relative frequency of data being
corrupted this way, compared to all the other ways that it might get messed
up. If it were a thousand times more likely that data got silently corrupted
on its path to media, sitting spinning on the media, and then back off the
drive again - then all this fancy stuff wouldn't make any real difference.
I have no data on the relative error rates of memory and i/o - so I can't
answer this.
