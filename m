Ahh, I think I see the bug. From rpc_timeout_upcall_queue:

-----------------------[snip]--------------------------
        dentry = dget(pipe->dentry);
        spin_unlock(&pipe->lock);
        if (dentry) {
                rpc_purge_list(&RPC_I(dentry->d_inode)->waitq,
                               &free_list, destroy_msg, -ETIMEDOUT);
                dput(dentry);
        }
-----------------------[snip]--------------------------

...when there is no dentry (as there wouldn't be when rpc_pipefs isn't
mounted), then the rpc_purge_list won't run. FWIW, you'd probably see
similar problems if you attempted a sec=krb5 mount without having
rpc_pipefs mounted.

I'm still looking at the code to see what the right fix is. For now,
making sure you have a /var/lib/nfs/v4recoverydir is probably the
easiest workaround.
