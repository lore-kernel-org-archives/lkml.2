I'm sorry you are given a runaround like this with that code.

You could also twist this around and argue the same for cpu usage and
make it part of the cpu cgroup, but it doesn't really fit in either
subsystem, IMO.

What was wrong with that again?

3) Make it an integral part of cgroups, because keeping track of tasks
in them already is, so it would be a more natural approach than
bolting it onto the memory controller.

But this has the same overhead.  And even if this would end up being a
better idea, we could still do this after merging it as a separate
controller as long as we maintain the interface.

Instead of integrating it task-wise, could the problem be solved by
accounting the kernel stack to kmem?  And then have a kmem limit,
which we already want anway?

After all, we would only restrict the number of tasks for the
resources they require, not to only allow an arbitrary number of tasks
(unless one wants to sell Windows 7 Starter style containers, in which
case one can go play with oneself out of tree as far as I'm concerned)
