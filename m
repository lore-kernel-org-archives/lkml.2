Most of the calls to this initialization function apply it on zeroed
memory (static/kzalloc'd...), which makes it useless. I'd actually be in
favor of removing those redundant calls (as I pointed out in another
email), and document that zeroed memory don't need to be explicitly
initialized.

Those sites that need to really reinitialize memory, or initialize it
(if located on the stack or in non-zeroed dynamically allocated memory)
could use a memset to 0, which will likely be faster than setting to
NULL on many architectures.

About testing, I'd recommend taking the few sites that still need the
initialization function, and just initialize the array with garbage
before calling the initialization function. Things should blow up quite
quickly. Doing it as a one-off thing might be enough to catch any issue.
I don't think we need extra magic numbers to catch issues in this rather
obvious init function.

Thanks,

Mathieu
