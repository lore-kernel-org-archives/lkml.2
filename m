I agree that we should have a generic way to do this rather than an
ia64-specific way.  In this case you have EFI, but the same thing
could happen with BIOS.

The firmware left the memory BAR at 0x24 cleared (0x00000000), but it
also left the MEM bit in the command register disabled.  So it seems
like a Linux bug that we're trying to use that zero address from the
BAR.  If the firmware left the MEM or IO decode enable bit cleared,
why would we assume it put anything useful in the corresponding BARs?

What would break if we paid attention to the command register enables
in the PCI core and just cleared the resource flags for MEM BARs if
the MEM-decode bit was off, and those for IO BARs if the IO-decode bit
was off?

I don't know much of the ancient history here, so maybe there's a good
reason why this works the way it currently does.
