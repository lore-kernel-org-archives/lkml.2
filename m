That argument doesn't seem right.  The queue teardown (i.e., the call
to scsi_free_queue()) was moved by commit 86cbfb5607d4b81b ([SCSI] put
stricter guards on queue dead checks).  Here's the changelog:

    SCSI uses request_queue->queuedata == NULL as a signal that the queue
    is dying.  We set this state in the sdev release function.  However,
    this allows a small window where we release the last reference but
    haven't quite got to this stage yet and so something will try to take
    a reference in scsi_request_fn and oops.  It's very rare, but we had a
    report here, so we're pushing this as a bug fix
    
    The actual fix is to set request_queue->queuedata to NULL in
    scsi_remove_device() before we drop the reference.  This causes
    correct automatic rejects from scsi_request_fn as people who hold
    additional references try to submit work and prevents anything from
    getting a new reference to the sdev that way.

It's quite evident that the point of the commit was to move the line
setting queue->queuedata to NULL; the scsi_free_queue() call merely
went along for the ride (by mistake perhaps?).  I don't see any reason
why moving scsi_free_queue() back to where it was should cause a
problem.
