This is what came out:

[    5.220654] NFS: nfs mount opts='vers=2,udp,rsize=4096,wsize=4096,nolock,addr=0.0.0.0'
[    5.226382] NFS:   parsing nfs mount option 'vers=2'
[    5.227707] NFS:   parsing nfs mount option 'udp'
[    5.228781] NFS:   parsing nfs mount option 'rsize=4096'

Within nfsroot.txt, it says I should specify "root=/dev/nfs" so that
nfsroot would be used. Why do we try mounting nfsroot if I specifically
specify something else under "root="?
