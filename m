Sure.  I guess I can go do that on the e2fsprogs side too.

For that to happen the UUID+inode would have to checksum to zero, which seems
fairly unlikely since I set the "initial" value in ext4_chksum to ~0 to avoid
the case where UUID = 0, and there's no such thing as inode 0, which means thee
likelihood of the checksum being 0 at this point ought to be 1:2^32.  Even
then, the checksum will be different if the value of i_generation changes.

That said, if we /do/ implement this, then perhaps e2fsprogs should be taught
to set i_generation, as it does not do that currently.

Ok.  Maybe put it in feature_removal_schedule.txt too?  Maybe not; the ioctl is
not being totally removed, it's merely unsupported for the metadata_csum case.
