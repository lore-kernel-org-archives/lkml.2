We also need the below patch set to make sure the permission check
function does the right thing. This patch is a part of second patch set
[1] pointed above. We add it as a part of the later series because it is
better explained with isolate owner and group patchset. 

commit 01a3a0c12dc4b87cdee11cd101b3ceefaa331e41

    richacl: Restrict access check algorithm
    
    We want to avoid applying the file masks to an acl when changing the
    file permission bits or performing an access check.  On the other hand,
    when we *do* apply the file masks to the acl, we want the resulting acl
    to produce the same access check results with the standard nfs4 access
    check algorithm as the richacl access check algorithm with the original
    acl.  This is already the case, except in the following scenario:
    
    With file masks equivalent to file mode 0600, the following acl would
    grant the owner rw access if the owner is in the owning group:
    
       group@:rw::allow
    
    There is no way to express this in an nfs4 acl; the result is always a
    more restrictive acl.  There are two approaches to deal with this
    difference: either accept that it exists and that applying the file
    masks is imperfect, or change the richacl access check algorithm so that
    such accesses are denied.
    
    This patch denies such accesses and makes sure that the richacl access
    check algorithm grants the same accesses as the nfsv4 acl with the file
    masks applied.
