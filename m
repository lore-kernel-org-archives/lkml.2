Tested-By: Tony Vroon <tony@linx.net>

This survived a 'cvs up' in /cvs/gentoo-x86 with only the CVS directory
in place; a workload that died at roughly 90% before. I did my best to
recreate the heavy I/O conditions that existed when it died there
before, with Evolution being opened just as cvs starts the first writes.
I opened Transmission-gtk with a few LiveDVD ISOs just for good measure.
The system was loaded enough for "su -" to stall for 20 seconds at some
points but ext4 survived now.

I do believe you have found the culprit, many thanks :)
