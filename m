As I said: we just need a by-preferred type of link.

Not all tools try to deduce the name ... most just use what they're
given.  So some tools need changing, but it's by no means all tools.

Look at this as an opportunity to get it right.  The original proposal
was for renaming.  By iterating over the actual requirements, we have it
reduced to simply having the kernel print a preferred name.  I think
that's a nice achievement which we can point other proponents of
renaming to as they arise.

Well, it's expediency.  Sure we could try to patch the world, but I
think the simple patch of getting the kernel to print a preferred name
solves 90% of the problem.  Sure there is a long tail of userspace
components that needs fixing, but that can be done gradually if we take
the kernel route.  If we go the userspace route, it will be a long while
before we even get to 50% coverage.
