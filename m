Some of this is due to my decision to use fstatat as an example, but we
should bear in mind that I've just been using that as an example. We'll
eventually have to do something similar for all path based syscalls in
order to fix tihs comprehensively.

While it may be possible to handle stat type calls atomically with a
simple LOOKUP call, other operations may require more than one round
trip. Consider chmod(), for instance...

Well, it's possible, but it seems pathological to me for a server to do
that...

Bruce and I were discussing this the other day. It would be good to add
something like this to the RFCs:

"On a PUTFH, a server SHOULD hold a reference to the filehandle such
that it does not go stale over the life of the compound."

...or something along those lines. That's a different matter though and
not directly related to this. :)
