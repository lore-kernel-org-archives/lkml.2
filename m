I don't think moving symlink/hardling from pid ns to user ns is a good
idea as user ns is not matured yet.  Also we (Openwall) want to use Yama
almost as-is in our RHEL6 and RHEL5-based kernels with OpenVZ support
which don't have user namespaces yet at all (yes, it is not a cause for
mainline decisions :-) ).

While user ns is not yet ready, I don't clearly see what is the division
of security policies among namespaces including user namespace.  I had
a view that all stuff related to processes (i.e. distinct processes in
several ways) belongs to pid ns, all net stuff to net ns, etc.  If we
differentiate user ns and pid ns, only strictly things handling pids
(like kill(2), procfs, ptrace(2), etc.) belong to pid ns and all other
process-related stuff (like credentials handling, these symlink/hardling
things, etc.) belong to user namespaces.

Can we probably leave them in pid ns for now and when user ns is matured
just move it from pid ns to user ns?  Is it possible without breaking
Yama's ABI (I think so)?

Thanks,
