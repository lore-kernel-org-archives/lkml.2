Hi Joel,

So, the case where configfs will actually OOPs without the
->check_link() patch (or without some other internal solution) is on the
unlink(2) path is when the symlink is created to a destination outside
of the source struct config_group.  This may have not been exactly
apparent in my LIO-Target example, but here is another shot at an
example without the other complexities of target mode invovled.

Say we have two different struct config_subsystem in two different LKM
sub_parent and sub_child.  I will spare the actual mkdir(2) and ln(2)
calls here, but (I hope) these are obvious:

First, we start out with the parent source struct config_group from
sub_parent module:

	/sys/kernel/config/sub_parent/group1/parent/

Next, we have a symlink from sub_parent/group1/parent to a different LKM
in sub_child:

	/sys/kernel/config/sub_child/group1/src_0/src_link -> ../../../../sub_parent/group1/parent

And then a second symlink from sub_child/group1/src_0/src_link to a
sstuct config_group outside of group1, but still within sub_child:

	/sys/kernel/config/sub_child/group2/dst_0/dst_link -> ../../../group1/src_0/

So once the sub_child/group2/dest_0/dst_link has been created to back to
sub_child/group1/src_0/src_link, the oops will appear any time that
'unlink sub_child/group1/src_0/src_link' is called while the second
group2/dst_0/dst_link is still present.  I don't recall the actual
backtrace of the OOPs that occurs when the unlink(2) is called, but it
is easily reproducable .

I am really starting to think that fixing this properly below the struct
config_item_operations API is going to make the most sense, but I have
not realized this in a patch for fs/configfs/ just yet..  I am happy to
do this in the next days if you think this would be the cleanest
resolution for the above case.

Thanks Joel!
