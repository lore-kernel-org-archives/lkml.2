... patch removed

I have finally had time to review and test this patch set. I am sorry thi=
s=20
has taken so long.

I have found one change of behaviour and a theoretical problem:
The new code does not re-use the tape numbers when freed and re-scanned.=20
The current code does re-use the freed numbers. Are there any reasons for=
=20
this changed behaviour? (The theoretical problem is that the new code=20
frees the tape structure but leaves the pointer in the idr tree.)

The patch at the end of this message (applies after the whole series) is=20
an attempt to implement re-use of tape numbers. I am not completely sure=20
that the change is correctly placed but it seems to work.

Another minor thing is that the documentation should be updated :-)

The patch at the end also updates the version code. I am not sure if the=20
version code is useful, but it should be either updated or removed.

Otherwise no problems found. I am ready to ack the patch set after the=20
re-use thing has been resolved (one way or another).

Thanks,
Kai
