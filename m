Because nobody supports >14-bit LUNs.  The in-kernel LIO target doesn't, 
I don't know anything that does.

Well, 256/8 is actually 32, but yes. :)  But it's more likely that you 
would do multipathing and ALUA on the host, and present a single path to 
the guest using the QEMU SCSI target.  The guest would see a single disk 
that just works.

The structure of the LUN is defined by SAM, not by me.  I specified a 
mandatory subset for two reason: 1) simplicity of implementation; 2) 
nobody supports the full hierarchical LUNs spec (SCSI has a lot of 
fringe features), so you need to standardize on something to start with.

Also, you can always have more than one HBA.  You do not even have to 
hotplug the HBAs, you can start a guest with 8 HBAs on a single 
multifunction PCI device, and add disks to them as you see fit.

> Again, why not now? Any extension would require a feature bit, no?

No, because the guest would simply scan a wider LUN space, and it would 
not find anything on older hosts.  It could also look at the 
max_channel/max_target/max_lun fields in the configuration and print a 
warning to the user that some targets may not be accessible.
