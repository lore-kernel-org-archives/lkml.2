First of all, thanks a *huge* for comments Vasiliy! Yes, agreed that plain
single xor is not sufficient here.

Yes, dump-start/dump-end is a mininum timeframe.

We might use PT_SEIZED as such flag and don't allow to allocate new kernel
objects but it will bring too much complexity into kernel code I think,
which is not what we want eventually ;)

It's limited to /proc/$pid/

Yes, this is main concern.

This is not that important I think, since it's not a time-critical operation.
