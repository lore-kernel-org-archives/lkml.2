Actually, I was trying to get out what I had. There's a bit more patches
that I need to process still. This being one of them.

But what I sent out previously is not going into 2.6.40 anyway. Ingo
feels that it's too late in the merge window to pull those changes and
wants to wait till the next merge window. Since there's some fixes in
that pull request, I'll need to cherry pick them out and rebase the rest
for the next window.

I'll look at this patch soon. It's still in my queue "todo" ;)
