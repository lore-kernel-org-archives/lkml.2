Actually it's the other way around, but the point still stands.

So, unfortuantely, I looked at doing this and we can't.  the ->readdir()
call takes an array of pages, not a kernel virtual address of the pages,
so there's no way to tell it to use a different mapping from the usual
kernel one on them.

On the other hand, the xdr routines, since they take the pages anyway,
could use a scatterlist approach to writing through the kernel mapping
instead of using vmap ... we have all the machinery for this in
lib/scatterlist.c ... it's not designed for this case, since it's
designed to allow arbitrary linear reads and writes on a block
scatterlist, but the principle is the same ... it looks like it would be
rather a big patch, though ...
