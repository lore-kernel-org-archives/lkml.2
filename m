No, lib/lzo has no identifiable maintainer.  I suggest you proceed as
follows:

- Post the entire patch series to lkml for review (I'd like a cc please)

- After that process has played out, ask Stephen to add this git tree
  to linux-next.

- After that process has played out, ask Linus to pull the tree
  during a merge window.

I haven't actually looked at the patches yet, but if they are as
extensive as they sound, it would be appropriate for you become the
formal maintainer of lib/lzo.
