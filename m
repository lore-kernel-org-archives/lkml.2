As I wrote in 
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2011-November/msg00151.html , 
down_read_trylock doesn't fix the freeze deadlock. Think of this sequence:

Process 1 (freezing)
down_write(&sb->s_umount);
set the filesystem to frozen state
up_write(&sb->s_umount);

Process 2 (executing the code from the patch)
down_read_trylock(&sb->s_umount); - succeeds, because s_umount is not held
writeback_inodes_sb(sb, reason); - waits, because the filesystem is frozen

Process 1 (unfreezing)
down_write(&sb->s_umount); - deadlock (process 1 is waiting for process 2 
to drop the lock; process 2 is waiting for process 1 to unfreeze).

See the patch at 
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2011-November/msg00151.html , it 
has a different approach and it avoids the mentined freeze deadlock.
