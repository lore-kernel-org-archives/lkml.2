It's generally more maintainable than a random list of 
architecture exclusions because every (old or new) architecture 
can just grep for ARCH_SUPPORTS_ pattern and see whether they 
support everything that others support.

The above exclusion list of architectures is much harder to find 
in a structured way.

That is one off overhead and it makes things easier to maintain 
going forward.

Anyway, that's the current upstream technique and it's been in 
place for years.

Yes, that's another possible solution, assuming that it's really 
only about the up/down difference.

Thanks,
