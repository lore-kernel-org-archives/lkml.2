    I'm not sure i have understand your means, is it like this?

    # cat /etc/exports
      /nfsroot	*(fsid=0,insecure,no_root_squash,rw)

    # mkdir -p /nfsroot/nfsroot
    # touch /nfsroot/tstfile
    # service nfs restart
    # mount -t nfs 127.0.0.1:/nfsroot  /mnt

    # ls /mnt <== Here, we access real /nfsroot/nfsroot, not /nfsroot,
                  so we can not find "tstfile", right?

    Actually, when we use "-t nfs", nfs-utils try to mount NFSv4 first,
    if you want use NFSv3, you should use "-t nfs -o vers=3" in the nfs-utils-1.2.2.

    As i see, there's no way to disabe nlockmgr, it's start by lockd,
    and lockd will be up when we start nfsd. It's always work until the
    last nfsd thread stop.
