That helpful advice would have been welcome about 3-4 months ago when I
first proposed this in detail. At that point you're working with
multiple upcall/downcall mechanisms, which was something I was keen to
avoid.

I'm not opposed to moving in that direction, but it basically means
you're going to rip out everything I've got here so far and replace it.

If you're willing to do that work, I'll be happy to work with you on
it, but I don't have the time or inclination to do that on my own right
now.
