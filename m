I've checked the code, and more importantly, tested the
setting-forward example - timers do indeed fire at the point the clock
is wound forwards. This means there doesn't appear to be a utility for
this patch in the cron case.

In the wound back case, I believe that even current cron goes to some
effort to avoid firing events that have already happened?
