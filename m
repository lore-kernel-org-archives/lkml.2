Just to clarify since I'm not a major GPL expert. Are you:

a) distributing a Linux kernel

b) with a module built against it to be linked into it, whether
completely written in house or not?

Then the module is under the GPL, if you think you are like nvidia or
someone then think again, the corner case they live under is that they
don't distribute a Linux kernel with their module *ever*, and they
have a clear call for non-derived work status since its 90% the same
code as in their Windows drivers.

But if you distribute a kernel and a module in one place which I
assume RTS OS does, then you are in dangerous territory and could be
hit with cease and desist notices, which has happened to people
shipping kernels and linked nvidia binary drivers before.

Dave.
