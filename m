Well, yes, that would be nice. I can certainly try to verify that it
stops my filesystems getting corrupted. (And if so, I owe you a
$BEVERAGE. Though I suspect I owe you about three million of those
already for other code written in the past.)

A full *install* from scratch, no. I was more worried about the
possibility of someone running -stable kernels on an existing distro
installation, and shutting down every night (given what's been happening
to UK electricity prices in the last few years I suspect there are quite
a lot of people doing that in the UK to save power). If they happen not
to do much on one particular day other than a bit of light distro
updating, they could perfectly well end up roasting things touched
during the distro update. Things like glibc :(

I was first hit by it in /var before I was even trying to bisect: I was
just rebooting to unwedge NFS lockd. It's true that in less than a week
probably not all that many people have rebooted often enough to trip
over this.

I hope.
