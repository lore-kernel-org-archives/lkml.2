Yes, this should be fixed, I already realized this. work->func(ns) is
called when ns is already fixed.

Otherwise, nobody should use ns->proc_mount when ns is already dead/freed.

Yes,

it clears ei->pid.

We are called from free_pid_ns() path, this ->pid must not have any reference.
Any get_pid() implies get_pid_ns().

What do you think?
