Hi,

In running iozone for writes to small files, we noticed a pretty big
discrepency between the performance of the deadline and cfq I/O
schedulers.  Investigation showed that I/O was being issued from 2
different contexts: the iozone process itself, and the jbd/sdh-8 thread
(as expected).  Because of the way cfq performs slice idling, the delays
introduced between the metadata and data I/Os were significant.  For
example, cfq would see about 7MB/s versus deadline's 35 for the same
workload.  I also tested fs_mark with writing and fsyncing 1000 64k
files, and a similar 5x performance difference was observed.  Eric
Sandeen suggested that I flag the journal writes as metadata, and once I
did that, the performance difference went away completely (cfq has
special logic to prioritize metadata I/O).

This is similar to the jbd2 patch I posted earlier that Ted has accepted
into his patch queue.  Comments, as always, are appreciated.
