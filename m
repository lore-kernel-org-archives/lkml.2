Quite frankly, I'm not going to pull this without lots of explanations.

The VFS-level changes have no acks or sign-offs from anybody else, and
quite frankly, if I understand them correctly they look f*cking
disgusting. If I read them right, they break delegations of a file
(which can involve long waits for clients - no?) while holding on to
the directory inode lock (both directories for cross-inode renames).
Which seems to be a singularly idiotic thing to do and sounds to me
like a fundamental design mistake.

We simply don't do these kinds of VFS changes without having
discussions and acks from people, notably Al.

As to "second pull later" - if you haven't reviewed the code already,
it's damn well much too late in the merge window to do it now.

So quite frankly, this *all* looks like 3.6 material to me, and that's
assuming you can convince people that file-delegation breaking really
should happen with all lookups on the directory the file is in blocked
by the directory inode mutex in the first place. Or tell me I'm a
moron and I misread the patches and don't know what I'm talking about.
