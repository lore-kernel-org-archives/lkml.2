I'm still missing your position (other than you now wanting to make it
a userspace concern).

Put differently: why should CFQ still be the default?

It is pretty widely held that deadline is the more sane default
(multiple distros are now using it, deadline is default for guests,
etc).  CFQ has become more niche.  The Linux default really should
reflect this.

The only case where defaulting to CFQ seems to make sense is
rotational SATA (and USB).
