Local tranports uses UNIX sockets and connecting of these sockets is done in
context of file system namespace (i.e. task file system root).
Currenly, all sockets connect operations are performed by rpciod work queue,
which actually means, that any service will be registered in the same
rpcbind instance regardless to process file system root.
This is not suitable for containers, which usually have it's own nested root.
There are 2 approaches, how the problem can be solved.

First one is to store proper root in transport and switch to it in rpciod
workqueue function for connect operations. But this looks ugly and such
approach was rejected by community.

The second one is to connect to unix sockets synchronously, which is
implemented by this patch.

But there should be noted, that such implementation introduces limitation
(Trond's quote):
"That approach can fall afoul of the selinux restrictions on the process
context. Processes that are allowed to write data, may not be allowed to
create sockets or call connect(). That is the main reason for doing it
in the rpciod context, which is a clean kernel process context."
