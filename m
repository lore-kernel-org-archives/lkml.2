No one is arguing about the advantages of snapshots. I think that we are
all clear on this. Snapshots are useful.

And why is that ? With LVM you can shrink or extent volumes at will, I
do not think this is a problem at all, moreover, you can always add more
drives to resize your existing volumes to.

You can very well avoid this kind of problems when you separate
filesystem and snapshots, that is what LVM can do easily.

Very easy to do with dm-multisnap.

And that is for being fs level snapshots a huge drawback.
