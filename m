There seems to be a lot of, perhaps, misinformation here.

The looping occurs when the file system on the server returns a valid file handle during a pathname traversal and then returns ESTALE on a subsequent operation.

The client should retry the pathname traversal, which should either return a valid file handle or ENOENT.  If a subsequent operation returns ESTALE, then start over again at the original pathname traversal.

The client should not loop when 1) there is a signal pending which would cause the system call to terminate with EINTR or when it can't recover from the ESTALE return.  For example, if lookup("./foo") returns ESTALE, then clearly the current directory has become stale and there is no way for the client to recover.  One could make the argument that the client can recover by relooking up the current directory, which is fine, but eventually if the file handle for the root of the mounted file system is also stale, then there is no further recovery possible, at least for NFSv[23] and perhaps even for NFSv4 depending upon how the file system was mounted.

I think that engaging again with Miklos and/or Bernd to understand why the underlying file system would return valid file identification information, but then be unable to use it in a subsequent operation.  The definition of ESTALE is that a file handle, which referred to a valid file, no longer refers to a valid file.  Why should FUSE impose any special requirements in this regard?  If FUSE has attempted to expand the definition of ESTALE, then we should consider this situation and perhaps make recommendations for a more appropriate errno to use.

The bottom line is that for pathname based system calls, the application should never see an ESTALE error.  The system call should either succeed or fail on its own merits or fail with ENOENT.

	Thanx...

It's important to note that I'm only proposing to wrap syscalls this way that take a pathname argument. We can't do anything about those that don't since at that point we have no way to retry the lookup.

So, I'm not sure this patch would affect the case you're concerned about one way or another. If you move the file to a different directory, then it's pathname would also change, and at that point you'd end up with an ENOENT error or something on the next retry.

If the file was open and you were (for instance) reading or writing to it from a client when you moved it, then we can't retry the lookup at that point. The open is long since done and the pathname is now gone.
You'll get an ESTALE back in userspace regardless.

That sounds like a broken cluster configuration. Still...

Presumably at some point in the future, a sysadmin would intervene and fix the situation such that /scratch is available again. Is it better to return an error to the application at that point, or simply allow it to keep retrying until the problem has been fixed?

The person with the long running job that's doing operations in /scratch would probably prefer the latter. If not, then they could always send the program a fatal signal to stop it altogether.
