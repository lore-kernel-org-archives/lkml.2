You confuse a bug fix with a prevention of an exploitation technique
here.  ASLR doesn't fix anything, it tries to break exploits that use
bugs like arbitrary writes/reads.  If there is arbitrary write bug,
almost always the game is over; that's why such probabilistic measure is
acceptable.  On the contrary, /proc/*/io leak is a bug, which is fairly
fixable by restricting an access (breaking programs, though).  So, from
the security point of view these cases are not comparable.

Yes, it breaks iotop, but it is a full solution.

If taskstats info is allowed to travel through credential changes, it
exposes the similar private information.
