All except how to enable richacl in local file system is ready. I
actually floated two ideas in the patch series

1) mount option
2) Ext4 compat flags.

If we can get to decide which one, then the entire set can go in. We also
want others to review the richacl format. If that cannot be completed by
next merge window there is no reason to prevent the vfs changes from
going in. VFS changes are independent of richacl format.
