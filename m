Agreed, ext3's probably a lost cause here.

OK, so that leaves us with the race, even on newer filesystems:

	1. File is modified, mtime updated
	2. Client fetches mtime to revalidate cache
	3. File is modified again, mtime updated
	4. Client fetches new mtime to revalidate cache

If step 3 doesn't change the mtime, then step 4 (no matter how much
later it is performed) will return the wrong result, and client
applications will see stale data.

If we want to avoid that race, every modification of file data must
result in the mtime being updated to something different from the last
mtime seen by the client.

(A slight window between data modification and mtime update may be OK,
as long as the update happens eventually, and before the change is
committed to disk--close-to-open semantics mean that NFS clients can
live with not seeing changes until data is written to disk.)

Possible responses:

	- Tell everyone to use NFSv4 (and make sure we have
	  changeattr/i_version working correctly).
	- Use a finer-grained time source.  (I believe you when you say
	  the TSC is too slow, but maybe we should run some tests to
	  make sure.)
	- Increment mtime by a nanosecond when necessary.  
	- ?
