A matter of intent, really, and who proposed it.

There are extra dates and version numbers potentially available.  This may be
useful in making backups.  Ask Andreas.

So that you can decide not to use it.  Some of our filesystems fabricate things
that they don't actually store.

Otherwise we end up with #ifdefs and duplicated fields of different sizes
within stat structs, and fields of "long" types which vary in size, depending
on the environment.

I just want to make sure that:

       - st_ino is stored as 64-bit
       - st_size and st_blocks are stored 64-bit
       - st.{a,b,c,m}time.tv_sec are stored 64-bit

We could probably stand to make st_blksize 32-bit.  I'd quite like to leave
st_gen as 64-bits and I definitely want to leave st_data_version as 64-bits.

Already done.

I can perhaps agree on the device numbers, though some filesystems we have can
store numbers that can't be represented by dev_t.  I think, however, everything
we have can be handled by a 32:32 split.  The numbers could then be encoded as
desired in userspace.

The problem with using extant time structs is they use "long" or "unsigned
long".  And I specifically want to get away from that, since it might be
32-bits or it might be 64-bits.

Perhaps, but it contrasts nicely with request_mask, and makes it easier to
document.

Acceptable.

Well, they are.

Yeah.  I've been thinking that's probably the better thing to do.

Or, as someone else has already said, return -E2BIG if the result won't fit.

Firstly: Lightweight stat: I want to say that the filesystem may return data
that is out of date if it isn't asked for specifically, but the filesystem has
a copy available.  But I'm not sure that this should apply to non-standard
fields.

Secondly: It doesn't matter what POSIX wants; not all filesystems we support
have everything available.  Where something that's standard is not available,
we have the opportunity to indicate this, whilst still providing a fabricated
result, so that the user can take note of this fact if they choose to, whilst
totally ignoring the indication if they prefer, and just using the fabrication.
