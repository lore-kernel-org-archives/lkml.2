Why is it hard?

Could you hack umount to do the equivalent of "exportfs -f" before
calling the umount?

Right, so I don't think you want protocol modifications.  They take a
few years to get hammered out and then make it into implementations, and
they won't help a great deal with your problem anyway.  (Because of
problems like the possibility of lost "unmount" calls that Trond
mentions.)

Either modify umount itself to flush the export cache before attempting
the unmount, or if that doesn't work perhaps you could patch the kernel
to notify nfsd on unmount and let it attemt to clear its caches before
deciding whether the filesystem is busy.
