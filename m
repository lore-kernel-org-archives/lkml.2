Actually the patch turns out to be irrelevant because Pavel made the
whole thing into a pernet subsystem, so it was already fixed in a
different way.  (Commit 2f72c9b7.  My bad, I initially started working
against an NFS tree with an older kernel version, this fix was to a
different source file so my patch still applied, and I just regression
tested that it worked, not that it still failed without it.  Just caught
it now.)

I actually did talk about addressing potential reuse of the net * in my
email with Stanislav (point of the patch was to allow one cache to
maintain two different contexts at the same time; a situation that
changed the meaning of an existing cache entry by requiring the old
context to go away didn't introduce any new problems that a single
context didn't already have due to DNAT, servers moving, administrators
changing credentials on the server).  But sort of a moot point now.

I believe the third patch can be dropped entirely.
