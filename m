And that mm_struct will explode and only the VFS will catch it.

Given  1024 processes * (RLIMIT_NOFILE 1024 - 3) == ~1020000

more than 1020000 mm structs (all of dead processes ?)


A quick test on a default ubuntu:
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
388411

So we are able to keep around 388411 dead mm_struct in memory, just try it.

Our embedded devices will suffer, serial login will be killed, getty, ...
ssh root owned ... I've experienced this.

I'll try to post more numbers.

That allocation is much smaller and it can be used to protect all
/proc/<pid>/* files in a unified way. Consistency seems the right thing
to do, even the /proc/<pid>/{syscall,stack,...} that do not operate on mm
structs will be protected. I don't know how you will protect these files ?


We can even remove the allocation and just reference the exec_id or use
other fields of the file struct.

I'm must admit that grsecurity just did the check in the seq files, they
did not add anything, this can leave some other files unprotected, but it
is cheaper.

Well, it protect as from wraps.

That's not fair since most of the logic of /proc/<pid>/* files is in
fs/proc/base.c and we can clean the code, there are some duplicated
functions in my patch, which we can improve.

As I've said we can improve it.

I'll take all the feedback I got and re-work the patches, in the meantime
some of these sensitive files need to be protected especially the
/proc/<pid>/{maps,smaps,numa_maps}

I'll re-submit.

Thanks for the feedback.
