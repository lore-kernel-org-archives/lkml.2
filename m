Hi Allison,

as I mentioned in the commit description I believe that I have
seen problems with punch hole implementation. You can apply the
commit to add discard support for loop device and then here is how
to reproduce the problem:


# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdd
# mount /dev/sdd /mnt/test
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test/bigfil2 bs=4096 seek=100M count=1
# mkfs.ext4 /mnt/test/bigfil2
# mount -o loop /mnt/test/bigfil2 /mnt/test3/
# fstrim -v /mnt/test3/
422650347520 Bytes were trimmed

# fsck.ext4 -fn /mnt/test1/bigfil2
e2fsck 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information
Block bitmap differences:  +(524288--532511)
Fix? no

Free blocks count wrong for group #16 (24544, counted=32768).
Fix? no

Free blocks count wrong (103161576, counted=103169800).
Fix? no


/mnt/test1/bigfil2: ********** WARNING: Filesystem still has errors
**********

/mnt/test1/bigfil2: 11/26214400 files (0.0% non-contiguous),
1696024/104857600 blocks

And we also get corrupted file system on the ext3 image. I did
not saw that for other file systems, but it is probably just the matter
of how are blocks laid out in the file system format and there are more
chunks of free blocks in ext[43] than xfs, or btrfs.

Also you can find fstrim in latest util-inux-ng. And lastly I believe
that this is great way to validate punch hole implementation. Just
create an image on ext4 file system and run xfstest 251 (or stress.sh -
oss.oracle.com/~mason/stress.sh) on it the image mounted with -o
discard.

Thanks!
-Lukas
