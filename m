Right. Or there can be a need for a completely different access pattern
to do 32-bit, or maybe write only one half because both might have a
side effect etc etc etc ...

Also a global lock would be suboptimal vs. a per device lock burried in
the driver.

Agreed.

And we want a well defined #ifdef drivers test to know whether there's a
writeq/readq (just #define writeq/readq itself is fine even if it's an
inline function, we do that elsewhere) so they can have a fallback
scenario.

This is important as these can be used in very performance critical code
path.

Cheers,
Ben.
