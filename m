I am running an internal test tool that creates files with a known
pattern until the disk is full, reads the data to verify if the
pattern is still intact, removes the files and starts over.

# uname -r
2.6.34

# mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda

WARNING! - Btrfs Btrfs v0.19 IS EXPERIMENTAL
WARNING! - see http://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org before using

Btrfs Btrfs v0.19
    
# mount /dev/sda /mnt/esslv0/

The kernel log shows:

I guess this is to be expected, since the test tool keeps writing
until there is no space left.

This is the output from my debug patch where i see the mismatch
between the data and the provided guard tags in the block integrity
data.

As expected, the controller detects the checksum mismatch in the same
request and this is reported as an error for the request. But the
running application is not affected.

I can start this again to get more data, but for now, this is what i
see.
