It would be helpful if already the generic block layer would offer 
device error counters. Then btrfs could read them, add own counters for 
its checksum detected errors, and store everything persistently in the 
filesystem.

The goal is to replace disks that have an increased error rate with 
spare disks, and the goal is to repair this degenerated RAID state quickly.
