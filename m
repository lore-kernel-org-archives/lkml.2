The RBC device parameters mode page followed by a Power
Condition mode page. The RBC device parameters mode page
is the only SCSI page I have seen (mode, log, VPD, etc)
with a 5 byte field!

Decoded response to a probable MODE SENSE(6) "fetch all
pages" command:
   RBC device parameters mpage:
     WCD=0 [double negative: write cache enabled]
     Logical block size: 512 bytes
     Number of logical blocks: 0x12A19EB0 *** [160 GB]
     Power/performance: 0x3c
     READD: 0 [READ enabled]
     WRITED: 0 [WRITE enabled]
     FORMATD: 0 [FORMAT UNIT enabled]
     LOCKD: 1 [media cannot be locked]
   Power Condition mpage:
     IDLE=0
     STANDBY=1
     IDLE_CONDITION_TIMER=0
     STANDBY_CONDITION_TIMER=0xbb8 [300 seconds]

Hopefully Seagate will switch to UAS(P) in the near future.


*** That is _not_ the address of the last valid LB as in
     the SCSI READ CAPACITY command!

No. You need to also take into account the RBC
device parameters mode page if present. See above.
