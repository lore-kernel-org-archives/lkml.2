Which means that if I want to do a reflink copy between two separately
mounted subvolumes, I will have to go and do a third mount with a common
subvolume above those two, then do the reflink operation within this
extra mount? This seems slightly impractical.

Is it any extra code to enable doing cross-mount reflinks? Why was the
decision made not to allow them?

Is there some particular opposition to supporting cross-mount operations
on multiple mounts of the same filesystem in general? (I'd love to have
rename() work across bind mounts, for example...)
