The latter - the file, which is considered to be restricted to a process
as W only without ability to truncate it, now can be truncated.  The
process after (4) had no such ability without map_files/ with current
permission model of mmap'ed files.  Or I am missing something?

FWIW, ftruncate() might be not the only syscall which makes sense to use
in this case, I just thought about it.
