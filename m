Seems clear that we must fix mpath to receive the SCSI errors, in some
form, so it can decide if a retry is required/valid or not.

Such error processing was a big selling point for the transition from
bio-based to request-based multipath; so it's unfortunate that this
piece has been left until now.

Hannes already proposed some patches:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/61282/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/61283/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/61596/

This work was discussed at LSF, see "Error Handling - Hannes Reinecke"
here: http://lwn.net/Articles/400589/

I thought James, Alasdair and others offered some guidance on what he'd
like to see...

Unfortunately, even though I was at this LSF session, I can't recall any
specific consensus on how Hannes' work should be refactored (to avoid
adding SCSI sense processing code directly in dm-mpath).  Maybe James,
Hannes or others remember?

Was it enough to just have the SCSI sense processing code split out in a
new sub-section of the SCSI midlayer -- and then DM calls that code?

I'll have to review this thread again to understand why mpath's existing
retry logic is broken behavior.  mpath is used with more capable SCSI
devices so I'm missing why a failed FLUSH implies data loss.
