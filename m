Here's another one:

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3081
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=634457
https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-40265

"The compat_alloc_user_space functions in include/asm/compat.h files in
the Linux kernel before 2.6.36-rc4-git2 on 64-bit platforms do not
properly allocate the userspace memory required for the 32-bit
compatibility layer, which allows local users to gain privileges by
leveraging the ability of the compat_mc_getsockopt function (aka the
MCAST_MSFILTER getsockopt support) to control a certain length value,
related to a "stack pointer underflow" issue, as exploited in the wild
in September 2010."

It would have been nice if this one were not exploitable from 64-bit
OpenVZ containers at the time, which, if I understand correctly, would
be the case with Vasiliy's patch (and the corresponding change to vzctl
to make use of the feature, which we're planning to make).

Similarly, it would be nice if 32-bit compat issues like this would not
be triggerable from privsep child processes of vsftpd, sshd, etc. -
those programs would need to set a flag via prctl(), which we'll add
support for.

Vasiliy is going to reuse a check (of multiple flags at once) that is
already in the code, so the change will have no performance impact for
permitted and non-traced syscalls (the case where we care about
performance).
