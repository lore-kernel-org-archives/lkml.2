Yes, you did not understand this structure. And Yes I am right, when
using chained lists you *must* use sg_set_page().

You see the chaining belongs to the allocation not the value of the
sg-elements. One must not copy the chaining marker to the destination
array which might have it's own. And one must not crap all over the
destination chaining markers, set at allocation time.

The sizes and mostly the pointers of source and destination are not
the same.

Only the source code I'm afraid.

In SCSI land most LLDs should support chaining just by virtu of using the
for_each_sg macro. That all it takes. Your code above does support it.
(In Wang version).

Though more code need probably be added at sg allocation to actually
allocate and prepare a chain.

Well that can be done as well, (If done carefully) It should be easy to add
chained fragments to both the end of a given chain just as at beginning.

It only means that the last element of the appended-to chain moves to
the next fragment and it's place is replaced by a link.

If you have ready made two long segments A and C which you would like not
to reallocate and copy, you insert a two-elements segment in the middle, say
call it B.

The first element of B is the last element of A which is now used as the pointer
to B, and the 2nd element of B is a pointer to C.

That's just going backwards, and lazy. As you said if you want to enjoy
the better performance cake you better break some eggs ;-)
