Hi,

I am reading this discussion via the kernel-hardening list.

To me, this is primarily a privacy feature on multi-user servers.  This
was the primary intent behind my original implementation for Linux 2.0,
for which there was demand.  Then I forward-ported this (still as an
unofficial patch) to 2.2 and later to 2.4, and Brad Spengler
forward-ported it to 2.4 and 2.6 in grsecurity.  There was always
demand, primarily for privacy.

On shared web hosts that run users' scripts as the users (for greater
security and resource limits separation), process lists reveal website
access activity of each hosting user to others.

Network connections reveal where other users are connecting from and to,
which may be a privacy leak and it may allow for more focused attacks.

As to attacks not limited to reduced privacy for the users, but allowing
for unauthorized access as a next step, real-world'ish examples include
capturing passwords and filenames that another user (or their script)
passes via a command line.  Yes, it is wrong to pass sensitive info like
that, yet it is sometimes done.  Partial countermeasures such as mysql
overwriting -pXXX in argv (which it does) leave race conditions.
Restricting access to other users' process info is a more complete
countermeasure.  Even if a bypass is ever found, it may be fixed as a
bug.  Thus, the countermeasure is not as fundamentally flawed as
zeroizing of argv (yet I have nothing against that being done as well, I
find it just fine as long as its limitations are understood).
Then there are things such as usernames to other resources (databases,
etc.), which may allow for more focused attacks.  As to filenames, it is
quite common for users to share semi-private files via a mode 711
directory, so the filenames become somewhat sensitive.  (Of course, I am
aware of ways for users to avoid that, but security hardening, which is
what we're doing here, is about reducing risks assuming that user
behavior stays the same.  This does not imply that it should stay the
same.  We may be advocating for changes in behavior towards best
practices.  This is just multi-layered security, where one layer does
not depend on another.)

My original patches used stricter permissions only.  However, in this
discussion it was pointed out that this could be bypassed via netlink.
[ I am curious to know when this became possible - that is, whether some
of my old patches were similarly insufficient in that respect or not. ]
I did not follow the discussion closely, but my understanding is that
Vasiliy started changing things in response to that finding.

My understanding is that they (at least start-stop-daemon) check owner
info (for good reasons), but not permissions.  So we're free to change
permissions.

Thanks,

Alexander
