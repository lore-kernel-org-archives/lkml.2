  Hmm, I don't think it's really about "how to not let pages change" - that
is doable by using wait_on_page_writeback() in ->page_mkwrite and
->write_begin. I think the discussion is more about whether we should do it
or whether we should rechecksum and resubmit IO in case of checksum failure
as Nick proposed...
