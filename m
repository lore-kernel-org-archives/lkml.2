Err...

First of all, plz correct me if this is in some kind of wiki, web page or
the like, but I have not been able to find it. All this things should be
on a document somewhere, perhaps even in the kernel itself...
These are the things I have found out (thanks to your answers...).
I'm a long time unix admin, not new to NFS, but all this things were not
obvious to me, so perhaps they deserve to be in a document, something like
"NFS 3 to 4 migration for dummy admins":

- Everything just works if you mount shares as nfs4. Even, if you have a
  bunch of linux boxen with recent kernel/nfs-utils, probably you are
  already doing nfs4... modern mount tries nfs4 first.

- Using nfsroot with fsid=0 is not mandatory, nor bind-mounting everything
  under some /export (like many documents say), that only forces you to
  use the old way of specifying paths in the server (absolute, not
  relative to /export).

- Even if you use nfsroot(fsid=0), and you mount it on the client
  at /somepoint, you are not forced to mount everything else under
  /somepoint (plz, correct me if I'm wrong).

- You can strip your server for NFS4, but not too much... Old daemons
  are still needed locally. For example, you can get rid of NFS2 and
  UDP for nfsd (-N 2 -U, -any os still uses NFS2??-), and old
  mount protocols (-N 1 -N 2 for mountd)...

- ... but they can be firewalled, use is just local

- portmap/rpcbind is not needed, but still used because nfsd is not
  yet proper clean for only-nfs4-behavior.

There are also some things I have not been able to discover, like
using the interesting things of NFS4:

- How do you activate delegations ? Is this an automatic thing, or
  do I have to add any option somewhere ?

- How do you use cache ? Many docs talk about fsc option, but man
  does not mention it (nfs-utils 1.2.2).
  I have tried to use cachefiles module, and cachefilesd, but
  when I try to run it, I get:

bran:~/c/cachefilesd-0.10# ./cachefilesd -dddns -f $PWD/cachefilesd.conf
About to bind cache
CacheFiles bind failed: errno 95 (Operation not supported)

In dmesg:
[cachef] ==> cachefiles_get_security_ID({system_u:system_r:cachefiles_kernel_t:s0})
CacheFiles: Security denies permission to nominate security context: error -95

I can not run cachefiles without SELinux or something like that ?

Thanks, perhaps this notes help someone in the future. 

TIA
