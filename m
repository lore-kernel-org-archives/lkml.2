You're right, but even this will basically always set the write flag,
since some bits will be set the same, even for reads.  Eg:

#define READ_10               0x28
#define WRITE_10              0x2a

It should instead be:

> +	if (pcmd->cmnd[0] == WRITE_6 || pcmd->cmnd[0] == WRITE_10 ||
> +			pcmd->cmnd[0] == WRITE_12 ){

That will of course miss other commands which do writes, such as UNMAP
and WRITE_32.  So we should do it properly:

	if (pcmd->sc_data_direction == DMA_TO_DEVICE)
		arcmsr_cdb->Flags |= ARCMSR_CDB_FLAG_WRITE;

I don't have an Areca card to test with.
