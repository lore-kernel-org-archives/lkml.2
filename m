The existence of the pdf could be useful information when one needs to 
locate a copy. I think the filename needs to be retained.

That's the wrong document. It refers to processor number 440 not the *440 
chipsets.

Links to the datasheetarchive are probably redundant. We have search 
engines for that. Also, there are three devices supported by this driver 
and your link is only good for one of them, so searching is likely to be 
needed anyway.

The site is actually http://www.myson.com.tw/ but there's no product 
information there any longer. I'd suggest this (also correcting the typo):

-        Say Y here to support the Mysom MTD-800 family of PCI-based Ethernet

Why? Catalyst is not related to Mach64. Here's the URL you want:

You won't find any info at amd.com but at least it works in the web

This URL you have provided is certainly pap but otherwise it doesn't 
relate. The URL you removed looks like advertising for a division that

I wouldn't think that you'd get support there. It claims to be the

google cached the poliba.it link on 19 Sep 2010, so I don't think this 
needs to be patched. Besides, it is also in the web archive.
