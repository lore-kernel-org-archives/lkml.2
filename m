Just because we can't do it right now doesn't mean it is not
possible. Array/raid controller vendors need to implement the SCSI
block limit VPD page, and if they do then stripe unit/stripe width
may be exposed for the device in sysfs. However, I haven't seen any
devices except for md and dm that actually export values that
reflect sunit/swidth in the files:

/sys/block/<dev>/queue/minimum_io_size
/sys/block/<dev>/queue/optimal_io_size

There's information about it here:

http://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2009/ols2009-pages-235-238.pdf

But what we really need here is for RAID vendors to implement the
part of the SCSI protocol that gives us the necessary information.

MD doesn't care whether the block devices are single disks or RAID
LUNS.  In this case, it's up to you to configure the md chunk size
appropriately for those devices. i.e. the MD chunk size needs to be
the RAID6 lun stripe width. If you get the MD config right, then
mkfs will do exactly the right thing without needing to be tweaked.
The same goes for any sort of heirarchical aggregation of storage -
if you don't get the geometry right at each level, then performance
will suck.

FWIW, SGI has been using XFS in complex, multilayer, multipath,
heirarchical configurations like this for 15 years.  What you
describe is a typical, everyday configuration that XFS is used on
and it is this sort of configuration we tend to optimise the
default behaviour for....

Which means you're assuming a competent admin is running the tool,
in which case they could just run mkfs directly.  Anyway, it still
doesn't need mkfs changes.

Writing such a script would be a good way to learn the art and
document the information that people are complaining that is
lacking. I don't have the time (or need) to write such a script, but
I can answer questions when they arise should someone decide to do
it....

Cheers,

Dave.
