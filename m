Not stepping into the debate: I'm happy to see punch go to the mapping
data and FITRIM pick it up later.

However, I think it's time to question whether we actually still want to
allow online discard at all.  Most of the benchmarks show it to be a net
lose to almost everything (either SSD or Thinly Provisioned arrays), so
it's become an "enable this to degrade performance" option with no
upside.
