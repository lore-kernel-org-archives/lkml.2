Even when they became kernel threads, 'kill' was the only way to kill them -
at first.

rpc.nfsd 0

will stop all nfsd threads.  Follow with

  exportfs -f

and you should be done.  I'm not 100% sure about the nfsv4 thread though -
would need to check.

And yes - I would love it if distros could standardise on start/stop scripts
so upstreams could maintain them sensibly.  This is my personal number 1
reason for liking systemd - it pushes for this standardisation.

That's kinda neat.  It would be an ugly wart to have to keep around, but
sometimes that the price we pay for "no regressions".
