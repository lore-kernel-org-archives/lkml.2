OK, so I understand the commercial imperatives.  However, when a trusted
reviewer raises issues, and I check and find myself agreeing, I need
them addressed to make forward progress.

The issue is simple:

      * We can put all the auth mechanisms in the kernel, so we need a
        userspace upcall anyway
      * Since we have to have an upcall, it should be the default path
        for everything (so it gets well tested).

Just saying "everything has to be in the kernel because mixed
user/kernel code is too complex" doesn't fly because we already have a
growing list of counter examples, some of which were cited.
