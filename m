Sure Alan, seize on "proprietary" and "EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL".. and gloss
right over the fact that what is being proposed is reasonable.

Any multipath driver should be able to detach a scsi_dh module.  As is
evidenced by the fact that they can already make use of sysfs to do so.

Relaxing the scsi_dh_detach interface makes it easier for a long
standing proprietary driver to get out of Linux's way.

But yeah, I'm sure you'll gloss over that too.

_Upstream_ has kept it that way because we've been concerned about
breaking PowerPath in enterprises where Linux is deployed.  Upstream has
been good citizens to the fault of Linux.

Please stop being a drama queen and stop putting words in my mouth.

Remind me again when you ever developed anything to do with scsi_dh?

To be clear: PowerPath doesn't _need_ this.  Not even close.

Linux is improved by not having to walk on egg shells that attaching a
helpful linux-only layer in kernel will somehow screw up some 3rd party
software that a customer values.

You still don't get it... yet you'll saber rattle behind generic GPL
lawyer-up nonsense.

It is sad that you didn't even read the important technical aspects of
my previous reply that prove you're being a troll.

I implore you to defer to the domain experts and refrain from continued
late Friday night geek melo-drama.
