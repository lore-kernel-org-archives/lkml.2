Ok, I looked at your patch closer.  I think it can still cause
bad race conditions.

For instance:

Assume that tk_callback is NULL at beginning of while loop in __rpc_execute,
and tk_action is rpc_exit_task.

While do_action(task) is being called, tk_action is set to NULL in rpc_exit_task.

But, right after tk_action is set to NULL in rpc_exit_task, the rpc_killall_tasks
method calls rpc_exit, which sets tk_action back to rpc_exit_task.

I believe this could cause the xprt_release(task) logic to be called in the
work-queue's execution of rpc_exit_task due to tk_action != NULL when
it should not be.

I have no hard evidence this exact scenario is happening in my case, but I
believe the code is still racy with your patch.

For that matter, is it safe to modify the flags in rpc_killall_tasks:

rovr->tk_flags |= RPC_TASK_KILLED;

Is that guaranteed to be atomic with any other modification of flags?

Thanks,
Ben
