Fair enough. In this case, lock_task_sighand() would be the right choice
if locking is needed.

Ok. You're right, the RCU grace period is just what I need to ensure I
won't dereference a stale pointer. So I don't even have to bother with
->siglock and just check pid_alive() before peeking into pid->numbers.
