The ability to use the SG_IO ioctl on a block device was added at
the start of the lk 2.6 series. It should have been restricted to
non-partition block device nodes (e.g. allowed on /dev/sda,
disallowed on /dev/sda3).

The successor to sg_dd is called ddpt which will abort a copy when
the pass-through (requested by "iflag=pt") is used on a partition
node:

# ddpt if=/dev/sda3 iflag=pt bs=512 of=/dev/null count=1
 >> warning: Size of input block device is different from pt size.
 >> Pass-through on block partition can give unexpected offsets.
 >> Abort copy, use iflag=force to override.

ddpt is ported to FreeBSD and Win32. The ability to call a pass-through
on a partition node is a Linux specific problem.

Is that a fixed version of patch at the end of this post:
     http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=132578310403616&w=2
The fix being
   s/ENOIOCTLCMD/-ENOIOCTLCMD/
in is_unrecognized_ioctl() ?

If not could you post the patch you are referring to the linux-scsi
list. Also could you post "PATCH v2 3/3 ..." to this list as well so
we have a complete set?
