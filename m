Also from the client that sent the setattr? I, as Trond, understood that
the read delegation must be recalled from all clients but the one
doing the setattr/write.

other wise what does it mean:
 "allowed to keep its read delegation while writing to the file"

I think the server should filter out it's global recall to dis-include
the caller.

Though I agree that the client must get a writable stateid for
setattr, and should not use it's  read-delegation-stateid

The above recall filtering will solve that. I know that in layout recalls
we have such facility, and we actually use it in RAID5 exofs.
