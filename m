	No problem.  I'm sorry I was so busy that we couldn't iron this
out a few months ago.  I'm glad we're getting somewhere.

	Right.  If someone pokes around and makes it stop working,
that's their fault.  What we (configfs and TCM) must guarantee is that
user poking doesn't cause a crash or put things in an unrecoverable
state.  "Remove all TCM mappins" is a valid recovery state, though
"Recreate the symlink and it works again" is a better one.

	This sounds like a good plan for initial inclusion.

	I think we can revisit this as necessary.
