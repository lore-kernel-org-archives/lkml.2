Ok, fair enough..  I will go ahead and look at getting this cleaned up.

In the mean time, James please go ahead and apply patches #1 -> #20 from
this target core series to scsi-misc as I have no futher changes to
report at this time.  I will send out an updated PATCH 21/21 addressing
Christoph's comments for merging tcm_loop.ko shortly, and another RFC-v3
series addressing his comments for the initial iscsi_target_mod merge in
the next 24 hours.
