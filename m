Ugh. Honestly all of this talk of abusing different time fields seems
like craziness to me. It's going to be very hard to do that without
breaking *something*. There's also very little reason to do this when
xattrs are a much cleaner approach.

Neil Brown has put forth a very reasoned justification for putting the
birthtime in an xattr. After reading it, I think that makes more sense
than anything. It's also something that can be done without any extra
infrastructure. If at some point in the future we get an xstat-like
syscall then we can always add birthtime to that as well.

Ditto for the other fields under discussion (i_generation and the like).
