Well, we need to define *some* kind of lock ordering for i_mutex
belonging to regular files within a single file system, and ordering
them by inode number seemed to make the most amount of sense.  If it
turns out some other routine needs to do i_mutex locking of regular
files with some other lock ordering, we're certainly open to using
something else.

Yes, you're right, the ordering in double_down_write_data_sem() can go
away; it's harmless, and doesn't cost much, but it's strictly speaking
not necessary.

Actually, we're not modifying the contents of the file that is being
defragged, only the donor file, so there shouldn't be any need to nuke
the suid flag for the target file, just the donor.  But yes, we should
move the call into ext4_move_extents(), and since the donor file
should never have the suid flag on it anyway (unless someone is trying
to play tricks on us), the conditional shouldn't be necessary.

P.S.  Maybe it would be a good idea to add a mention of the fact that
file_remove_suid() needs i_mutex, either in mm/filemap.c as a comment,
or in Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt, or both?

Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix potential deadlock with setuid files and EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT

file_remove_suid() must be called with i_mutex down, since it calls
notify_change().  In addition, we really want to remove the suid file
*before* we modify the donor file, to avoid someone from trying to
exploit a race.
