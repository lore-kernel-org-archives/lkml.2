Yes, you are right.  I preallocate a file that is 256MB.

Yes, it is the same file.

I will run more detailed benchmarks to trace this issue.  If I have a
lastest result, I will send a new mail to let you know. :)

I fully understand that this flag will bring a security hole, and I
totally agree that we should dig *root cause* in ext4.  But, IMHO, a
proper interface, which is limited by a proper capabilities, might be
useful for the user.
