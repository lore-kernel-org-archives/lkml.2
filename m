Oh, nasty.

FWIW, the XFS code this was copied from doesn't have this problem
because the struct inode is not tagged for reclaim in
->destroy_inode until all writeback IO is completed.  We keep a
separate active ioend reference count in the struct xfs_inode, and
the inode is never freed while there are still active IO references
(see the xfs_ioend_wait() call in xfs_fs_destroy_inode).

Hence the XFS ->writepage path does not need to take inode
references to handle the possibility of an inode being freed from
under it because the inode lifecycle model guarantees it
cannot occur.  Perhaps ext4 needs to copy more from XFS.... ;)

BTW, io_end_cachep() probably should use a mempool (like the
equivalent XFS ioend slab cache), otherwise ext4 won't be able to
make writeback progress in OOM conditions and will avoid needing to
handle ENOMEM errors in ->writepage.

Cheers,

Dave.
