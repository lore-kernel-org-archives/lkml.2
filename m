Subject: [PATCH v4 0/2] nfs/sunrpc: allow freezing of tasks with NFS calls in flight

This patchset is the fourth attempt at fixing the issues with suspending
a machine that has an active NFS mount.

The bug reported against Fedora is here:

    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=717735

The main difference from v3 is that I've fixed a stupid set of errors in
freezable_schedule_timeout_killable. The if condition was reversed from
what it should have been, and the code did not call freezer_count()
again when it was going to return early.

Tejun has mentioned that the extra try_to_freeze() calls are unnecessary
on top of the pm-freezer changes, but this set should work on as
expected on top of 3.2-ish kernels. In the meantime, I'll look over the
pm-freezer changes and see whether I need to make changes in this set
for 3.3.

  sunrpc: make rpc_wait_bit_killable handle freeze events
  nfs: make TASK_KILLABLE sleeps attempt to freeze
