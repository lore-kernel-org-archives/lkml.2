I agree with you (what I understood originally is just like what you
said above).

thank for your confirmation.

1) I understand why my suggestion is not quite suitable. I agree you.

2) but, are we truly no ways to solve this issue ?  (I do not think so).

3) I think an executable way (but maybe not a good way) is :

   A) for each client, check each task id of the client its own (such as
rpc task xid), so can know the order of tasks of the client its own.

   B) maybe also need another some synchronization code, but I think it
does not have much negative effect with performance.

sorry for I am truly not quite familiar with nfs, I also think it is not
quite relative with current issue, so I have to skip it (although I
think these contents are valulable for Trond)
