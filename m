Splitting this up doesn't look like a silly idea -- I thought it was
unfortunate to have to patch a core file just to add a bus type.

I guess the question is how many new buses we get over time.  If they
only get added gradually, people might not be too concerned.  Of course,
this is one of those maintenance issues which can only get worse as time
goes on.
