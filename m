You are probably talking about memory overhead which is indeed not that
big (except for possible side effects as fragmentation which you mention
bellow). But the runtime overhead is present, as far as I understand from
what Glauber said. But, on the other hand, it is fair to say that those
who _want_ use the feature should pay for it.

Remember that users do not want to pay even "something minimal" when the
feature is not needed.

Not really. It doesn't have to do anything with the overhead (be it
memory or runtime). It really boils down to "do I need/want it at all".
Why would I want to think about how much kernel memory is in use in the
first place? Or do you think that user memory accounting should be
deprecated?

I am not sure which API visible part you have in mind but
kmem.limit_in_bytes will be there whether we go with global knob or "no
limit no accounting" approach.

While I do agree with you in general and being careful is at place in
this area as time shown several times, this seems to be too restrictive
in this particular case.
We won't save almost no code with the global knob so I am not sure
what we are actually saving here. Global knob will just give us all or
nothing semantic without making the whole thing simpler. You will stick
with static branches and checkes whether the group accountable anyway,
right?
