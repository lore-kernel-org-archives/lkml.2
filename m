Subject: [PATCH 0/5] ext2: Preparation to remove BKL
Date: Mon, 12 Apr 2010 22:41:40 +0200

In this series I've collected the patches that prepare ext2 for BKL removal.
It consist mostly of cleanups and additionally introduces a spinlock to protect
some of the superblock's fields against concurrent access. I've addressed the
feedback kindly provided by Ogawa-san by moving the ext2_write_super() out of
ext2_setup_super().

These patches have been part of the BKL removal series that I have posted in
November 2009 already. Since this is more than just removing the usage of the
big lock I repost it separately for inclusion. This series, at least the last
patch that includes the s_lock, needs to be merged before Frederics bkl-removal
branch, if he merges the rest of my patches there.

Thanks,
Jan
