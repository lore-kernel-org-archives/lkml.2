  ext4: fix handling of journalled quota options (2012-04-16 18:55:26 -0400)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Ext4 regression fixes for 3.4

This fixes a scalability problem reported by Andi Kleen and Tim Chen;
they were quite secretive about the precise nature of their workload,
but they later admitted that it only showed up when they were using a
large sparse file, so the amount of data I/O that was needed was close
to zero.  I'm not sure how realistic this is and it's only a
regression if you consider changes made since 2.6.39 to be a
"regression" vis-a-vis the policy regarding post-merge window bug
fixes, but Linus agreed it was worth fixing, so I'm including it in
this pull request.

This also fixes the journalled quota mount options, which I
accidentally broke while I was cleaning up the mount option handling.
