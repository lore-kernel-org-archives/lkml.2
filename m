I am currently checking two approaches.
1. Add flush cache code in current MOUNTPROC3_UMNT/MOUNTPROC_UMNT.
 -> I heard from Trond that there already are
MOUNTPROC3_UMNT/MOUNTPROC_UMNT. So I will try to fix this issue on
current protocols without many changes. It is not specification
violation.
2. Check your suggestion.
-> I think that your suggestion is very good. it will cover device
unplug case(automount will try to umount about unplugged device) and
current busy umount issue.
If I have one concern, It need to change VFS code. I need your review
and Ack to commit if I post this patch.

Thanks.
