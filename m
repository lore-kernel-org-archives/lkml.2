Which means you need to be able to compute a bounded amount of that
memory.

That seems unrelated, the VM has a strict dirty limit and controls
writeback when needed. That part works.

We have a smallish reserve, accessible with PF_MEMALLOC, but its use is
not regulated nor bounded, it just mostly works good enough.
