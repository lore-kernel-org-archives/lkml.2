Hi Bob,

Would you mind posting your current crc32 patches to lkml again?  A couple of
months have gone by, and it sure would be nice to replace the circa-July patch
in -next with a newer one.  I recall that there were requests for some code
changes even in Bob's 8/31 submission, so it'd be nice to have a fresh set from
you with your latest changes.

I'd also like to freshen my crc32c refactor patches and send them along too.

To clarify, I tried the new crc32{,c}  on my ppc32 and it passed the self test.
