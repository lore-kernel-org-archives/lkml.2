I'll admit that I was slightly surprised, too.

When unwritten extents are disabled, the IO takes the normal
overwrite/extending write path, which is as optimised as
the unwritten path because it is more commonly used.

It's and apples to apples comparison.

The code paths are identical on IO submission, the only difference
is the IO completion path. In the case of unwritten extents, it has
to do a transaction to convert the extents and update the file size.
In the case of the stale extent, it has to modify the file size
because the IO is beyond EOF.

My point, however, is that despite the complexity of unwritten
extent conversion it is not noticably more expensive than a file
size update transaction on XFS. Hence the reasoning for exposing
stale data due to unwritten conversion has too much overhead to be
useful is demonstratably false.

Cheers,

Dave.
