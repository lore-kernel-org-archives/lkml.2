This does not seem like an ext4 problem. The code seems unable to
actually discard blocks which are allocated. Moreover I was not able
to reproduce the problem on the loop device with the same setting as
the reported scsi_debug device (1024 bs file system on the 256MB image
residing on the 1024 bs filesystem) 

After a little bit of tracing with the systemtap and blktrace ext4
does not seem to be doing anything wrong and yet we get part of the
block bitmap trimmed. This lead me to the scsi_debug driver itself
and indeed it seems that we have off-by-one bug there in the
unamp_region() which is causing the problem.

Here is the patch which fixes the problem for me, I'll resend the
proper patch in a bit.
