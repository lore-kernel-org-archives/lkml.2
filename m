My limited experience shows that people won't change their habits until
those habits simply no longer work.  Adding a printf is probably a fine
thing to do, but I'm not sure it will have much impact on how people go
about mounting NFSv4 filesystems.  That leads me to believe that the
alias will be carried along for quite a while.

Anyway, the immediate problem can be solved by just keeping the alias in
a conf file.  If that's what is recommended for now, OK.
