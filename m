I don't really like the idea of introducing another errno as well.  It seems like too much complexity and represents complexity that no one has really justified needing.

This is a situation which we know happens in nature.  We should fix it and fix it correctly and not for just "part of the time".  The changes are pretty simple and straightforward, so complexity isn't even an argument.

A tunable sounds good, until it is needed, and when it is needed, it is too late.  The system should just work correctly on its own, so I don't think that this is such a good idea either.

	Thanx...

I figured as much... I just don't see any real world applications remove directory hierarchies without some type of synchronization locking...

Point. But if the reestablishment can not be done in one try, the I say we punt...

Why do you say this?  ESTALE the errno has been around forever... 
Its defined in the errno man page "ESTALE - Stale file handle (POSIX.1)"

Yeah... I understand the idea... I just don't think another error code is needed to handle this problem...

Well I thought the use of the fs_flags to register for this type of semantics was a good one...

steved.
