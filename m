I don't think it has to be complete.  As long as the STGT people think
it's good enough, that's fine by me.

This isn't really correct.  The ABI is defined by the headers not the
implementation.

If you mean is the marketing solution of wedging two products into the
kernel and calling it a single one going to fly, the answer is no.
