I think a format change would be preferable to runtime sorting.

So the index nodes contain the hash ranges for the leaf block, but the 
leaf block only contains the regular directory entries, not a hash for 
each name?  That would mean that adding or removing names would require 
moving around the regular directory entries wouldn't it?

I would think that hash collisions are rare enough that reading a 
directory block you end up not needing once in a blue moon would be 
chalked up under "who cares".  So just stick with hash, offset pairs to 
map the hash to the normal directory entry.
