Having looked closely I'd say it is almost certainly this issue.
nfsd thread 1266 is in zone_reclaim waiting on a page to be written out so
the memory can be reused.
The other nfsd threads are blocking on a mutex held by 1266.
The dd processes are waiting for pages to be written to the server

The particular page that 1266 is waiting on is almost certainly a page on an
NFS file, so you have a cyclic deadlock.

I wonder if we could use 'containers' to partition available memory between
'nfsd threads' and 'everything else'??  Probably not worth the effort.
