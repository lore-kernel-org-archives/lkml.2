  This is not really true in presence of mmaped writes. To block mmaped
writes on a frozen filesystem, we need some synchronization between
page_mkwrite() and freezing code. Currently, to avoid any additional
locking overhead, we set page dirty and *then* check for filesystem being
frozen. Only this order can make sure either the page is written (and
write-protected) or the frozen check triggers and we wait... (see the
comment in block_page_mkwrite()). The nasty sideeffect of this is that
there can be dirty pages & inodes on a frozen filesystem. We are blocked in
the page fault of these pages so user cannot write any data to these pages
but still they are marked dirty.

Alternatively we could have a different mechanism (rw semaphore?) to
synchronize page faults and freezing but I'd hate the overhead for the case
almost noone cares about...

  Sounds good.

  You cannot really turn the check into WARN_ON because we iterate over all
superblocks and only in ->quota_sync() check whether something is dirty.
But the check seems to be unnecessary, that is correct.

  Q_GETQUOTA can actually cause filesystem modification (reservation of
space in quota file) but the others are read-only. Also after some thought
I'd prefer that quotactl(8) just blocks to be consistent with how other
syscalls behave...
