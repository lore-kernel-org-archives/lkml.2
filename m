Ah-ha!

Stanislav Kinsbursky helped me reconstruct some of the reasoning: we
don't need to take a reference because we never actually dereference the
struct net *, all we do is feed them to net_eq() which just compares the
pointers for equality.  (The inline function exists so it can compile to
a constant "return 1" when configured out.)

So if the network context did go away (which still shouldn't happen
between the rpc_xprt and the struct nfs_client having references to it)
we still wouldn't have a use-after-free problem because we're not
looking at the memory, just the pointer.

So I shouldn't need to add get_net() and put_net() to the cache.  Sound
about right?
