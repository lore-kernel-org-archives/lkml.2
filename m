Let's put it like this. LZO is mature widely used production software and 
Markus wrote and maintains it.  Essentially this is a release from him.

The main problem before with using his version directly was that it did 
not follow Linux coding standards, but that seems to be fixed now. It's 
also relatively simple and at least I didn't spot anything bad when I looked.

It was runtime tested by several people on different architectures.
If it was fuzzed so we can assume reasonably good security.
