| For these specific cases, we declare some big data structures in the stack, which is not good
| and I will fix them. But is general, is passing 512 stack size check a requirement? This seems
| too strict for me since the default stack size is 8k.

Fixing the warnings for frame size exceeding 1024 is OK IMO.
The 512 test was just for more info.

Ah, I see, 8 KB stack is default on X86_32.

Thanks.
