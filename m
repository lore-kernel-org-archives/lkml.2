Thanks.

I think I see what you mean by "at the beginning" - the problem path is
simply ".", and both the start and end of that are "." so we can handle at
either end...  But I don't think there is any other special handling of the
'start' of a path, so I imagine it would be a fairly ugly special case.

We could avoid the extra GETATTR in "foo/bar/." by allowing NFS to keep some
state in the namei_data to record that it has valid attributes for a given
dentry so if it sees the same dentry again it doesn't need to revalidate.

I must confess though that I don't feel I understand VFS name lookup properly
any more.  Since intents were added it seems to have become much more obscure
and complex.  I cannot help thinking that there must be a better way:
distinguish between the various cases at a higher level so we don't need as
many flags being passed around and interpreted by widely separate pieces of
code.  I don't have a concrete proposal but I would certainly be interested
to work on one if there were any hope of real change.
Thoughts?

Thanks,
NeilBrown
