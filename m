That's a fair point. On the other hand if
you wanted to start working with the backup copy,
you might want it allocated to avoid fragmentation and ENOSPC issues.
What we were going with was empty -> hole with cp --sparse=always
and empty -> empty otherwise. If empty and hole can not be
distinguished though, then this process will be impacted.

Yes we definitely will start doing that.
That will help fragmentation and give early ENOSPC.
We can't use fiemap for this at the moment
(on XSF or ext4 (without a sync))
but the seek_data interface should allow us
to do this to some extent (pardon the pun).

cheers,
Pádraig.
