Actually, it can't because it leaves the file size unchanged.  Like
XFS_IOC_RESVSP, the use case is to allow punching out pre-allocated
blocks beyond EOF (that were put there by XFS_IOC_RESVSP). e.g:

# xfs_io -f \
> -c "truncate 20k" \
> -c "resvsp 16k 16k" \
> -c "unresvsp 24k 4k" \
> -c "bmap -v" \
> -c "stat" \
> test.out
test.out:
 EXT: FILE-OFFSET      BLOCK-RANGE      AG AG-OFFSET        TOTAL FLAGS
   0: [0..31]:         hole                                    32
   1: [32..47]:        136..151          0 (136..151)          16 10000
   2: [48..55]:        hole                                     8
   3: [56..63]:        160..167          0 (160..167)           8 10000
fd.path = "test.out"
fd.flags = non-sync,non-direct,read-write
stat.ino = 134
stat.type = regular file
stat.size = 20480
stat.blocks = 24
fsxattr.xflags = 0x2 [prealloc]
fsxattr.projid = 0
fsxattr.extsize = 0
fsxattr.nextents = 2
fsxattr.naextents = 0
dioattr.mem = 0x200
dioattr.miniosz = 512
dioattr.maxiosz = 2147483136
#

Which leaves us witha file size of 20k and two unwritten extents
from 16-24k and 28-32k.

Ask, and ye shall receive enlightenment. :)

Exactly. If you can preallocate beyond EOF, then you need to be able
to punch beyond EOF, too. The only other way to remove persistent
preallocation beyond EOF is to truncate, but that doesn't allow you
to only punch specific ranges beyond EOF...
