Doesn't BH_Lock prevent multple callers from submitting it for write
at the same time?  If memory serves, one of the reasons why we cleared
the dirty bit before submitting the write was because we allowed
writers to dirty the buffer_head while the write was "in flight".  Of
course, this is becomes problematic if we're trying to support DIF/DIX.

What if we simply disallow BH_Dirty from being set (and disallow the
modification of the buffer) while the buffer is locked?  Then the
dirty bit would indeed correctly track the state of the buffer
correctly.

That's another problem, which is that we need more context than just
!uptodate.  We need to know what sort of write I/O errors occurred, so
we can determine whether it's likely to be transient or permanent.

So how does XFS decide whether a write should fail and shutdown the
file system, or just "try forever"?
