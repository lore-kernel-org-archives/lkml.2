Could you describe the corruption, with logs?  The behaviour you list
below should may cause disk errors to the filesystem, but it shouldn't
cause corruption.

This would be a driver bug: QUEUE_FULL or BUSY should never cause aborts
of outstanding commands.

This isn't a good idea ... that return code causes retries for ever.  I
think the correct fix is just to make the QUEUE_FULL handling in the
driver work.
