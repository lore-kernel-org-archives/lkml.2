It greatly reduces the size of the field.  A full sockaddr_storage is more than 128 bytes, since it has to be able to store an AF_UNIX pathname.

My thinking cap is still on vacation.  I don't see anything immediately wrong with this as a temporary fix.  Has anyone tested this with a multi-homed IPv6 server?  How about link-local IPv6 addresses?
