Oh, man, what a troll.

Even my *TV* uses XFS. First google reference:

http://settorezero.blogspot.com/2010/10/xfs-filesystem-and-samsung-ledtvs.html

You won't find a more hostile "pull-the-drive-without-unmounting"
environment than a TV. XFS handles this sort of stuff just fine and
it has for a long time.

You still haven't grasped that there are many different
classes of IO errors and that some require different handling to
others. :/

I'm not saying that "try forever" is how all errors should be
handled. You are completely focussed on that as the only possible
error handling technique that can be used. Stop being stupid!

I'm saying that the dirty, uptodate, errored buffer should
be handled back to the filesystem so that it can decide what to do
with it.  For filesystems that can differentiate the types of
errors, let them choose how to handle the problem. Those that are
unable to handle the error can do the invalidation themselves. One
size does not fit all...

Cheers,

Dave.
