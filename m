Come on Ted, you are laying it on pretty thick now. It's ordinary
reference counting, and the use case you have here is exactly the one
that is described in the comment for bio_get(). You allocate the bio, it
has a single reference. The end_io function you define drops the
reference you had to this bio. Since IO can complete before submit_bio()
has returned, you need to grab an extra reference if you depend on
dereferencing the bio after submission.

And it'll work.

So don't use __GFP_WAIT, then it returns NULL.
