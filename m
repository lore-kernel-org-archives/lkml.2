Not currently, udev needs to keep track of all symlinks, and removes
the ones not specified in rules. There is not way for udev to track no
longer valid names.

We can not just add stuff to /dev without a udev database entry, it
would never get removed on device unplug and leave a real mess behind.

And creates a huge problem for everything that uses that name.

I really question any concept of _the_ name. My take on it: It will
never work in reality.

I don't think that solves the problem, no. We need _smart_ userspace
with a debug/error message channel from the kernel to userspace that
pops out _structured_ data. Userspace needs to index the data, and
merge a lot of userspace information into it.

Adding just another single-name to the kernel just makes the
much-too-dumb free-text printk() a bit more readable, but still sounds
not like a solution. Pimping up syslog is not the solution to this
problem, and it can't be solved in the kernel alone.

I don't think we can even solve 10% of the problems that way. It's
just a hack that makes stuff a bit more pretty, but doesn't provide
any reasonable solution to the problem. I doubt we can even make a
simple use case out of it, what name to put into that field for a
multipath setup.
