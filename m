Agreed that the code will run just fine if we wouldn't use hash_init().

This is a consistency problem. I didn't want to add a module_init() to modules that didn't have it just to get hash_init() in there.

I'll get it fixed.

My concern with using a memset(0) is that I'm going to break layering.

The hashtable uses hlist. hlist provides us with an entire family of init functions which I'm supposed to use to initialize hlist heads.

So while a memset(0) will work perfectly here, I consider that cheating - it results in an uglier code that assumes to know about hlist internals, and will probably break as soon as someone tries to do something to hlist.

I can think of several alternatives here, and all of them involve changes to hlist instead of the hashtable:

 - Remove INIT_HLIST_HEAD()/HLIST_HEAD()/HLIST_HEAD_INIT() and introduce a CLEAR_HLIST instead, documenting that it's enough to memset(0) the hlist to initialize it properly.
 - Add a block initializer INIT_HLIST_HEADS() or something similar that would initialize an array of heads.
