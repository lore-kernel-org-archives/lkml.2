I believe logging message use should be selected
to be as specific as possible (from high to low):

o <subsystem>_<level>
o netif_<level>
o netdev_<level>
o dev_<level>
o pr_<level>
o printk(KERN_<LEVEL>

I completely agree.

I'd like to see some new subsystem prefixes
created and used as well.  Maybe:

fs_<level> (like Ted's ext4_<foo>)
io_<level> (scsi/ide/mtd)
mm_<level>

There are probably a few others like
cpu/video/sound that might be useful.

I think it's better still to eliminate debug
code altogether via if (0) when reasonable
or use dynamic_debug (jump_tables) when
overall code size isn't an issue.

cheers, Joe
