If we try to get rid of WRITE completely between these 10 flushes then we
run the risk of starving other READS/WRITES as long as flushes are going on.

I did not understand this one. With improved back to back merge logic 
we have already optimized the flush case. So for 10 flush and one write
we seem to be issuing following (as per your mail).

1 flush (6 flush merged)--> WRITE --> 1flush (4 flush merged).

So where is the opprotinutiy for drive (non flush queuing drive) to optimize
flush here?

IOW, if flush merging is already working well, do we really want to move
in a direction where we can potentially starve other READ/WRITE happening
in an attempt to improve throughput for a sepecific workload.

Thanks
