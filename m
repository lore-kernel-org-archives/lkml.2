I just posted a patchset that should improve the performance of
buffered reads. It's rather large but should apply to current upstream
kernels. If you've had problems with cifs.ko read performance in the
past, then this would be a good time to step up and help test them.

If it makes things easier, then the patchset is also available via the
cifs-3.2 branch of my public git tree:

    http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/jlayton/linux.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/cifs-3.2
