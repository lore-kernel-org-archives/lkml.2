As you remember, We discussed this
issue(http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-nfs/msg29997.html) with you
before. you guided me to use exportfs -f call on nfs server.
It is hard to use this method on our system and nomally the user is
thinking it is problem device busy happen after umounting.

The details of specific case.
1. There are two target or two PC. and Client want to access files of
usb device on server.
2. the client try to mount usb mount point using nfs on sever after
plugging usb device.
3. we try to umount mount point directory on client.
4. and when we try to umount usb device mount directory server, device
busy message occured like this (umount: can't umount /mnt: Device or
resource busy)

Let me know in case you have any question.

Thanks.
