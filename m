Actually, just what will happen if you have a referral that would eventually
resolve to a directory you have no permissions to access?  AFAICS, you'll
end up trying it on all alternates, since nfs_follow_referral() will cheerfully
keep trying one variant after another, getting -EACCES from each.  Worse,
if there are nested referrals in it, you'll get all sequences of alternates
tried before you give up.

..o*O(at least it's merely exponential; Ackermann would be even more fun)
