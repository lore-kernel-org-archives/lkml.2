Yes, it would have to be measured in various workloads.

Does it have to be RO_COMPAT change though ? Since this would be both
forward and backward compatible.

What do you expect to gain by storing the index nodes outside the
directory entries ? Only to avoid reading the index nodes of both trees
when walking just one of it ? If I understand it correctly directory
blocks are laid out sequentially so reading it in cold cache state would
not pose much troubles I think. Nor the iteration through all of the
index nodes. However it would have to be measured first.

I am always hoping for the best :). We have had a good expedience with
the students here, but you'll never know that in advance. They'll have
the whole year to get through this, which is plenty of thine, but the
question of course is whether they'll use that time wisely :). But
anyway, I think it is definitely worth a try.

Thanks!
