Here is some of the heresay about Win7:

   TRIM commands are sent when:
      -- About 2/3 of partition is filled up, when file is (really) deleted,
           not when merely sending file to trash bin.
      -- In the above case, when trash bin gets emptied.
      -- In the above case, when partition is deleted.

So the behaviour may vary, depending upon how full the filesystem is
at any point in time.

Cheers
