I have actually tried exactly this earlier today (because while looking at 
this, I had an idea that putting volatile in place could be a workaround, 
causing gcc to generate a saner code), but it doesn't work either:

# cat x.c
struct x {
    long a;
    volatile unsigned int lock;
    unsigned int full:1;
};

void
wrong(struct x *ptr)
{
        ptr->full = 1;
}

int main()
{
        wrong(0);
}
# gcc -O2 x.c
# gdb -q ./a.out 
Reading symbols from /root/a.out...done.
(gdb) disassemble wrong
Dump of assembler code for function wrong:

   0x40000000000005e2 <+34>:                br.ret.sptk.many b0;;

In my opinion, this is a clear bug in gcc (while the original problem, 
without explitict volatile, is not a C spec violation per se, it's just 
very inconvenient :) ).
