Right.
If the error is safe/needed to retry using other paths, mpath should
retry even if REQ_FLUSH.  Otherwise, only one path failure may result
in system down.
Just passing any REQ_FLUSH error upwards regardless the error type
will make such situations, and users will feel the behavior as
unstable/unusable.

I'm not sure how long will it take.
Anyway, as you said, the flush error handling of dm-mpath is already
broken if data loss really happens on any storage used by dm-mpath.
Although it's a serious issue and quick fix is required, I think
you may leave the old behavior in your patch-set, since it's
a separate issue.

Thanks,
