Andreas have documented the details here
http://acl.bestbits.at/richacl/draft-gruenbacher-nfsv4-acls-in-posix-00.html

In short with respect to mode bits, the interaction between acl/mode
bits is more or less similar between posix acl and richacl. When we set
richacl we need to make sure that mode bits represent allowed permission
on the file system object. We need to do the above to be posix
compliant.  As per POSIX additional file access control mechanisms may
only further restrict the access permissions defined by the file
permission bits. You can find further details in the OLS 2010 paper on
richacl. http://www.fmeh.org/ols-2010-implementing-richacl-paper.pdf
