Yeah my wireless mouse also becomes insensitive nowadays (perhaps
running low on battery power?)

I just booted into the new kernel, did some compile testing and it looks good.

Anyway the classical "mouse pointer freezing up" problems are often
caused by waits in direct page reclaim and can be confirmed with large

allocstall      # the number of direct reclaims
nr_vmscan_write # the number of pageout()s

numbers in /proc/vmstat


FYI I'm testing desktop responsiveness remotely (as you know it could
be a painful test). The test scheme is to run

        make -j16  (or any other workloads)

as well as a small script to start some X apps and cycle through the
windows. By checking if there are second(s) long gaps in the below
progress messages, I confirm that the desktop is running smoothly.
