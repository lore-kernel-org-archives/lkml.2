This regression might be due to these two patches:

	d0be5ec8693944c2e2fc0de70fda9dbc1b93bd7d
	[SCSI] hpsa: do readl after writel in main i/o path to ensure commands don't get lost.

	Apparently we've been doin it rong for a decade, but only lately do we
	run into problems.
and
	fec62c368b9c8b05d5124ca6c3b8336b537f26f3
	[SCSI] hpsa: do not attempt to read from a write-only register

	Most smartarrays tolerate it, but a few new ones don't.
	Without this change some newer Smart Arrays will lock up
	and i/o will grind to a halt.

with the second patch being a correction to the first.

It seems like the readl after the writel should not be needed,
and wasn't needed for a very long time, but there is some very
hard to trigger and not yet well understood problem in which very
occasionally a command would get lost and the driver thinks a 
command is out, but controller firmware thinks all commands are
completed -- a circumstance which tends to make things grind to
a halt.

Those two patches avoid that problem.
