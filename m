I have been laying out the technical reasons against this, but these

We already completely drive configuration from userspace, and have a
python object library for doing this all of this so the application
level developer does not have to care way the underyling configfs layout
functions or actually looks like.

This is modern kernel/user split that makes the most sense for
iscsi-target mode and has taken years of effort to achieve, and is what
I have committed to support to Linus (CC'ed)

Trying to change that model by pushing iSCSI login state machine into
userspace is an acedemic project, and going to produce poor results
compared to what we already have.

Again, it's about consistency with the userspace library and the ability
to access all of the underlying iscsi-target functionality from an
object library for application developers, integrators, and test script
writers.

I understand from your high-level perspective it sounds like pushing
iSCSI login to userspace does not make any different to how this work
from the persective of rtslib, but it very much does so.

Wrong, this is a overly simplfied view of how things actually work.  It
involves alot of state sychronization.

Working from iscsi_target_nego.c:iscsi_target_locate_portal(), a login
attempt has to:

*) Locate TargetName (tiqn) via iscsit_get_tiqn_for_login()
*) Locate TargetPortalGroupTag (conn->tpg) via iscsit_get_tpg_from_np()
*) Locate NodeACL (se_node_acl) via core_tpg_check_initiator_node_acl()

The three structures that are located reference underlying struct
config_group objects at tiqn->tiqn_wwn->wwn_group,
tpg->tpg_se_tpg->tpg_group and se_node_acl->acl_group respectively.

We have to consider that any of these objects may be removed / changed
via configfs at any time.  That all means sychronization of kernel
objects if the complete login statemachine is living in userspace.

But that's not even the whole story..  We also have to deal with iSCSI
session reinstatement during the login process in
iscsi_target_login.c:iscsi_check_for_session_reinstatement() which needs
to:

*) Walk the list of active sessions on the endpoint to find a match
*) If an active session is found, force reinstatement via
iscsit_stop_session(), and once that is complete call
iscsit_close_session() to release the session.

The forcing reinstatement involves waiting for all outstanding I/O to
complete for the active nexus.  Again, this all means sychronization of
kernel objects if the complete login state machine is living in
userspace.

This already is by no means trivial code, and pushing this into
userspace unnecessary complicates everything that is already has to be
done, with no tangible upside benefit.
