Trond mentioned this:

	There has been a lot of interest in allowing the user to specify
	exactly which fields they want the filesystem to return, and whether
	or not the kernel can use cached data or not. The main use is to allow
	specification of a 'stat light' that could help speed up
	"readdir()+multiple stat()" type queries. At last year's Filesystem
	and Storage Workshop, Mark Fasheh actually came up with an initial
	design:

	  http://www.kerneltrap.com/mailarchive/linux-fsdevel/2009/4/7/5427274

It'd be easy enough to absorb the functionality from that patch.

I have one of those.  See the query_flags field.  One question, though, is how
to break things down.  Obvious groupings of the already extant stat stuff
might be:

	- st_dev, st_ino, st_mode, st_nlink, st_uid, st_gid, st_rdev, st_size
	- st_block, st_blksize
	- st_atime, st_mtime, st_ctime

However, what seems obvious to me might not be for some netfs or other.

Got that.

That's what I thought.  Linux has a tangled mess of stat structs:-/

I made it so that the syscall can return variable length data: the main xstat
struct, plus extra records yet to be defined.  They could even be variable
length and assembled/disassembled with something like the control message
macros for recvmsg().
