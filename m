Sure thing.  The block part isn't fixed yet and so the RFC tag.  Once
the block layer part is settled, it probably should be pulled into
dm/md and other trees and conversions should happen there.

Oh, you already cc'd them.  Great.  Hello, guys, the original thread
is

Hmmm... I think both issues don't exist in this incarnation of
conversion although I'm fairly sure there will be other issues.  :-)

I see but single pending flush and steady write streams w/o saturating
the mempool would be able to stall dm_wait_for_completeion(), no?  Eh
well, it's a separate issue, I guess.

Yeah and threw in WARN_ON() there to make sure REQ_FLUSH + data bios
don't slip through for whatever reason.

Oh, I was talking about the other way around.  Passing REQ_FUA in
bio->bi_rw down to member request_queues.  Sometimes while
constructing clone / split bios, the bit is lost (e.g. md raid5).

Yeah, but for that direction, just adding REQ_FUA to blk_queue_flush()
should be enough.  I'll add it.

Thanks.
