I was trying to word it so that I wouldn't have to explain the same things
over and over again after each patch version. :) But your version looks
better.

Yep, they somehow dropped out of my CC list in one of the previous
versions. I can provide a patch for man-pages, of course.

Shaun Reich (KDE) and Ken MacLeod (ITE) have contacted me recently asking
about my progress with this feature. They, as well as other potential
users for this are in CC. Their feedback was how I came up with the list
of usecases above.
