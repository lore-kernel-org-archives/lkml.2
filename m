Apologies for the garbage emails.  The corporate email server lost its mind,
and I'm well on my way to losing mine.... <grumble> <shakes fist>

They at least were so garbled that they're not attached to this thread.

> > Currently, AIO+DIO+O_SYNC writes are not actually sync'd (for xfs), or they
> > are sync'd before the I/O is actually issued (everybody else).  The following
> > patch series fixes this in two parts.  First, for the file systems that use
> > the generic routines, Jan has provided some generic infrastructure to perform
> > the syncs after the I/O is completed.  Second, for those file systems which
> > require some endio processing of their own for O_DIRECT writes (xfs and

> > updated xfs-tests 113 test [Jeff] posted earlier, as well as all of the tests
> > in the aio group.  [Jeff] tested ext3, ext4, xfs, and btrfs only.

> Since the original post a few months ago, this patchset doesn't seem to have
> made any progress.  An internal testing team here discovered that the issue
> also affects O_SYNC+AIO+DIO writes to block devices.  Worse yet, since the
> flushes were being issued (and waited upon) directly in the io_submit call
> graph, the io_submit calls themselves would take a very long time to complete.
> Therefore, I added another patch to move the flush to the io_end processing.

> This patchset has been tested (albeit lightly) against 3.7-rc6 on x64, with
> ext4, xfs, btrfs, vfat, jfs, hfsplus, ext2, ext3, and raw block devices.
