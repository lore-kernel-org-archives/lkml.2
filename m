I, on the other hand, would suggest that each layer be given the freedom, and
the responsibility, to do whatever it thinks is most appropriate.

This would probably involved checking the lower levels to see how many
strategies each has, and doing some appropriate arithmetic depending on how
it combines those devices.

One problem here is the assumption that the lower levels don't change, and we
know that not to be the case.
However this is already a problem.  It is entirely possible that the request
size parameters of devices can change at any moment, even while a request is
in-flight ... though we try to avoid that or work around it.

The sort of dependencies that we see forming here would probably just make
the problem worse.

Not sure what to do about it though.... maybe just hope it isn't a problem.
