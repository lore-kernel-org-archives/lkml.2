Yeah, at least that's nice and simple.  Personally, I'm always nervous
when we build in new limits like this.  Some joker somewhere always
manages to push up against them.

But such is life.  Maybe it's the right thing in the ext* design space.
The fixed number of possible inodes certainly makes it easier to pack
more inode offsets into the telldir cookie.
