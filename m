I believe the original patch was tested with a multi-homed server, but
probably just IPv4.  It would be useful to retest to make sure I didn't
introduce a typo on cleanup (my version is pushed to
git://linux-nfs.org/~bfields/linux.git for-2.6.38 now).  And, yes, the
IPv6 cases would be good to test as well.
