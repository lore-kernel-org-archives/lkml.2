I think the only way to get accurate CRCs is to stop modifications
from occurring while the page is under writeback. i.e. when a page
transitions from dirty to writeback we need to unmap any writable
mappings on the page, and then any new modifications (either by the
write() path or through ->fault) need to block waiting for
page writeback to complete before they can proceed...

If we can lock out modification during writeback, we can calculate
CRCs safely at any point in time the page is not mapped. e.g. we
could do the CRC calculation at copy-in time and store it on new
pages. During writeback, if the page has not been mapped then the
stored CRC can be used. If it has been mapped (say writeable
mappings clear the stored CRC during ->fault) then we can
recalculate the CRC once we've transitioned the page to being under
writeback...

Cheers,

Dave.
