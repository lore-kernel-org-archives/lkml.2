Right, but what about the related i_ctime change ? (i_ctime is updated in
other places...)

The i_ctime update must reflect the _appropriate_ inode modification
operation. This is why IMHO we should protect them to avoid a lost update.

BTW the i_generation which is used by NFS and fuse filesystems is updated
even if the inode is marked immutable, is this the intended behaviour?
