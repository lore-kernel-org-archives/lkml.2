Oh dear oh dear.

... which is quite likely if you're rebooting frequently to try to track
down some other kernel bug.

Ow. OK, it's a good thing I rebooted fast. :) and only fses that got
written to, but not too much, will see this. Hence my /usr/src stayed
intact because it had lots of updates of lots of tiny files, more than
enough to cause the journal to wrap over and over again, even
journalling only metadata. But /home doesn't see so many updates, and
neither does /var...

This seems to explain everything.

It looks like fscking everything will fix it (it'll replay the buggered
journal, mangling the metadata, but then fix up the scrambled metadata
and fix the journal's starting block). So I probably don't need to worry
about latent corruption hiding waiting to pounce. Phew.

No problem. This is my first data-corruption bug in more than seventeen
years of ext* use (it even survived horribly faulty RAM). I call that a
good record. And it happened one day after a full backup, and was
immediately highlighted by corruption of .bash_history and input/output
errors logging in -- and fsck pretty much fixed the problem, with only a
few missing files, one file full of garbage, and one high-ASCII filename
in a temporary directory to show for it. I call that luckier than I have
any right to be.

Plus, my faith in the amazingly fast bugfixing talents of ext4 devs is
undimmed! :)

I'll apply this tomorrow (enough fun with filesystem restoration for
today) and see what happens. (What could *possibly* go wrong?)

But I might not upgrade to stable kernels quite so often in future :(
you know what they say: once burnt, twice not upgrading before doing a
full backup!
