Since it doesn't seem to reported much, it is perhaps related to DM, but where the actual cause is I can't say, and the symptoms are in ext4, so that seems where to start.
Especially since it's odd that e2fsck doesn't report and fix anything (apart from the journal).

This time it IS happening WITHOUT a snapshot of this particular lvm-partition.
The numbers are currently always the same, so it's completely reproducible, just by copying say about 10-50 Mb of data to the filesystem.

serveerstertje:~# e2fsck -f /dev/serveerstertje/media
e2fsck 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
/dev/serveerstertje/media: recovering journal

It didn't prompt for any error and yes this is with running 3.5-rc1.
Perhaps fsck gets the correct numbers and matching numbers for the clusters in the bitmap and gd, and it only differs when actually writing something to the partition, due to some bug ?

I also saw a report from Kees Cook, he has slightly different numbers, 32258 clusters in bitmap, 32262 in gd, although the 32258 seems to match.
