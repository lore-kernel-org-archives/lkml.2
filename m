+Date:		February, 2003
+KernelVersion:	Unknown
+Contact:	James Bottomley <James.Bottomley@HansenPartnership.com>
+Description:
+		Read only integer which indicates whether the host is an
+		ancient ISA device which therefore requires extra bounce
+		buffering.

+Date:		March, 2004
+KernelVersion:	Unknown
+Contact:	James Bottomley <James.Bottomley@HansenPartnership.com>

+Contact:	James Bottomley <James.Bottomley@HansenPartnership.com>
+Description:
+		Write only attribute which causes the SCSI mid layer to
+		scan the SCSI host at the specified channel, bus, and id for
+		devices.  The integer decimal value of -1 interpreted as
+		an unsigned integer (4294967295 on most architectures) may
+		be used as a wild card.  For example:
+		echo 4294967295 4294967295 4294967295 > /sys/.../scan
