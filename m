Quite. The first few days of any problem diagnosis are often a process
of taking something from 'oh my god it might be the end of the world' to
'oh look it's really obscure, no wonder nobody has ever seen it before'.

This is quite *definitely* such a problem.

It appears I have taken up a new post as the Iraqi Information Minister.
This is why I was disturbed to see the thing hitting Phoronix and then
Slashdot: as the guy whose FSes are being eaten, this is probably not an
easy bug to hit! If it hits, the consequences are serious, but it
doesn't seem to be easy to hit. (I should perhaps have phrased the
subject line better, but I'd just had my $HOME eaten and was rather
stressed out...)

Quite.
