I agree that it is early days for trim/discard hardware implementations.
I hope that if it can be shown that it is useful (and if the hardware
vendors are following this thread!) then maybe it will spur them on to
providing faster implementations in the future. There doesn't seem to be
any technical reason why faster implementations are not possible.

Equally, FITRIM is useful since the overhead can be reduced to certain
points in time when a system is less busy. With GFS2 (this may well also
apply to OCFS2) doing a userspace trim is not very easy since there is
no simple way to access the locking for the fs from userspace, so it
would imply that an admin unmounted the filesystem on all nodes and then
runs a utility on just one node. Using FITRIM though, it would be
possible to perform the trim during normal fs operation (initiating
FITRIM from multiple nodes at once would also work correctly, even if it
is not desirable from a performance point of view)

GFS2 already has code for online discard, and the changes required to
support FITRIM are relatively small. Both online discard and FITRIM
simply require iterating through the resource group bitmaps and
generating discard requests depending on the bitmap states encountered.
I'm intending to put a patch together fairly shortly to implement FITRIM
for GFS2.

So I think there is a place for both approaches,

Steve.
