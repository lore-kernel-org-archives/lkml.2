I know, and I've programmed my chunk of concurrent code with those and
architecture-specific code too (or libatomic-ops for a bit more
ready-to-use portability).

That's what an access to an atomics-typed var would give you as well.

This is interesting, because GCC is currently not optimizing across
atomics but we we're considering working on this later.
Do you have real data about this, or is this based on analysis of
samples of compiled code?

Well, obviously...

If it would be so easy, then answering my questions would have been easy
too, right?  Which piece of source code?  The whole kernel?

And a precise definition of these reasons is what we need to agree on.

Even if I would have done it, it wouldn't be as rude as trying to imply
that other people aren't smart.
