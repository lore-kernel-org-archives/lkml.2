Good point. I will look for more there is the method flush only mount entry.

Users expected to unplug it on both read only and read/write.
And there is no way that system be prepared to know about the
intelligence when the user is going to unplug.
if the user really want to detach the device safely. There is an
option like the desktop PC - where, we can say - umount/eject the
device. There is a proper user interface for safe removal.
but they can not unplug safely if usb device is mounted with nfs
because of this issue.
