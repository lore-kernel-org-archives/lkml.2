Hi Giridhar!

I'm really happy to hear that Qlogic would like to expand it's upstream
target-mode support offerings based on the positive results from qla2xxx
with the target-mode development community thus far.

While it's going to be a busy ~8 weeks until 3.5 is released to resolve
the outstanding active I/O target shutdown issues with tcm_qla2xxx, I'm
eager to get these remaining issues get addressed for this first round.
 
I'm also really excited to see 83xx target mode support included as a
for-3.6 -> for-3.7 item..

:)

Thank you!
