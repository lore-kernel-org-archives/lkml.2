barrier=0 really means losemydata=1.  The plan I discussed with Jens was
to allow to disable the flush and fua semantics in the block layer, so
we'll have one new tunable for that, which is documented to causes these
issues.

That's bullshit.  The barrier option has traditionally meant that we
sent barrier requests, and now means thatwe send flush+fua requests.
There's no reason for a warning and option mislabling just because you
got the most efficient implementation of it.
