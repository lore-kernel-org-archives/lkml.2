A random thought: What if we allow the number to wrap at each level,
and, each time it wraps, increment the number passed to the next lower
level.

A zero would propagate down, letting each level do what it wants:
luks: 0
raid1: 0
raid6: 0
nbd: 0

And higher numbers would indicate the method at each level:

For a 1:
luks: 1
raid1: 1
raid6: 1
nbd: 1

For a 3:
luks: 1 (only one possibility, passes three down)
raid1: 1 (two possibilities, so we wrap back to one and pass two down,
since we wrapped once)
raid6: 2 (not wrapped)
nbd: 1

When the bottom-most level gets an N that it can't handle, it would
return EINVAL, which would be propagated up the stack.

This would allow the same algorithm of incrementing N until we receive
good data or EINVAL, and would exhaust all ways of reading the data at
all levels.
