And you've just illustrated my point better than I did - that
different filesytsems will suffer from different problems, but some
filesytsems will work better than others out of the box. :)

Of course, there's no guarantee XFS will remain this way - if you
want us to care about regressions of this sort at all, you need to
encapsulate all this behaviour in a set of automated tests.
Preferrably within the xfstests infrastructure because that now has
fairly wide usage within the fs dev community....

Cheers,

Dave.
