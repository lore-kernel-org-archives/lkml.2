Hmm, can the FS UUID change while the FS is mounted?  Or, to look at this from
the other side, does anyone mind if tune2fs -U can tell you to umount before
changing UUID?

I think we need that anyway, to prevent races between tune2fs checksum rewrite
and kernel writing stuff.

I found a bug where if you mount a fs and write to it, then dumpe2fs -h will
complain about superblock checksum errors.  Will have to look into that...

I wasn't planning to start on this optimization until I finish addressing all
the other comments/complaints.
