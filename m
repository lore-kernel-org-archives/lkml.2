It's been told people. The deprecation patch was on LKMl (I don't
remember whether I sent it to linux-arch), but there were a bunch of
related patches to clean out the old irq related cruft which were sent
to linux-arch and also hit the parisc tree. There is an entry in
feature-removal-schedule.txt for 18 month now.

CONFIG_ENABLE_WARN_DEPRECATED=y perhaps ?

I'm really tired of your whining when you did not get a personalized
taylored to your needs info.

14 architectures got converted and some maintainers sent out mail to
their users 18 month ago right after the deprecation patch was sent
(www.linux-mips.org/archives/linux-mips/2009-03/msg00068.html), there
were reviews of new architecture code on linux-arch where this was
pointed out, so don't tell me that there was not enough information
about this.

The replacement of what?
