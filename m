Peter's test just happens to demonstrate the problem well, but one
could envision someone removing a heirarchy of directories on the
server while we're trying to do other operations in it. At that point,
we can easily end up hitting an ESTALE twice while doing the lookup and
returning ESTALE back to userspace.

It's not an application issue. The application just asked the kernel
to do an operation on a pathname. The only reason you're getting an
ESTALE back in this situation is a shortcoming of the implementation.

We passed it a pathname after all, not a filehandle. ESTALE really has
no place as a return code in that situation...

Returning ESTALERETRY would be registering for it in a way and it is
somewhat cleaner than having to go all the way back up to the fstype to
figure out whether you want to retry it or not.

There's also the non-trivial matter of needing to retry during the
lookup itself. If the lookup just returns ESTALE, then you don't have
any way to know whether the underlying fs wanted you to retry it or
not...

I'm not thrilled with having to do all of this ESTALE to ESTALERETRY
conversion and back, but it does give us a way to neatly deal with and
ESTALE during the lookup.
