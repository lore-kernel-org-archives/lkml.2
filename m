I have some "idée fixe", that all this file system parts of SUNRPC (and NFS) 
layers have to made per network namespace context in the same manner as sysfs 
done. I.e. it's content should depends on mount point creator network namespace 
context instead of "current" one.
But proc (and sysctl's as well) doesn't allow to make it so simple like sysfs does.
So, currently sysctl's code is about 30 lines. With my patches in will be 
approximately 3-4 times longer.
But this "dependence on mount point creator network namespace" goal is achieved.
Anyway, I'll cleanup this code and send path set soon.
