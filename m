I don't disagree with the idea of removing it, especially as it has so
few users, but replacing the host lock with an atomic here would still
vastly reduce the contention, which is the initial complaint.  The
contention occurs because the host lock is so widely used for other
things.  The way to reduce that contention is firstly to reduce the
length of code covered by the lock and also reduce the actual number of
places where the lock is taken.  Compared with host lock's current vast
footprint, and atomic here is tiny.
