I think I'm mixing up complaints ;)  top-down balancing is unrelated to
the variable length items.  You could balance from the bottom up and if
you have a 1K item that can't be split next to a 3K item that can't be
split, we're going to have those two items in two leaves.  This is true
regardless of how we balance.  So the prime complaint here is that you
don't like variable length items, correct?

Ideally leaves are full, and ideally data blocks are full.  In practice
we can end up with either one utilized less than we would like.   At the
end of the day, every FS has a worst case setup where it is mostly empty
in terms of bytes stored but full in terms of blocks. On xfs:

for x in `seq 1 bazallion` ; echo 'f' > $x

This would work on ext4 too, until you ran out of inodes.

I'll reproduce from your test case and provide a fix.  mount -o
max_inline=1500 would give us 50% usage in the worst case (minus the
balancing bug you hit).
