It's worse than that. If you're using filesystem namespaces, how can
*any* shell script loop, or anything in userspace, reliably unmount all
filesystems before reboot? It seems to me this is impossible. There is
no process that necessarily has access to all namespaces, and when you
bring PID namespaces into the picture there is no process that can even
kill all userspace processes in order to zap their filesystems.

I suspect we need a new blocking 'umountall' syscall and a command that
calls it, which umounts everything it can in every filesystem namespace
it can, skipping those that are (unreachable?) network mounts, and
returns only when everything is done. (Possibly it should first kill
every process it sees in every PID namespace other than that of the
caller, too.)

Then shutdown scripts can just call this, and get the right behaviour
immediately.
