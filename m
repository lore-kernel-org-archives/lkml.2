Yeah I just didn't want to do all that work until I was sure the base of
what I had was acceptable.  If people think this set is good to go then
I will go through and fix everybody who does their own lseek.

So maybe we make SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE only work on regular files and not
directories?  Sunil what does solaris do?  Thanks,
