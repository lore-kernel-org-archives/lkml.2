Peter,

Note that we are planning on unexporting ext2_fs.h, and then utterly
removing it from the tree (with what fs/ext2 needs being moved to
fs/ext2/ext2.h).

Someone who was compiling "the latest version" of syslinux has
submitted a kernel bugzilla entry that this was breaking due to
ext2_fs.h using umode_t which was no longer being exported by the
kernel header files.  Given that ext2_fs.h is about to go ***poof***
(Al already has the changes in his vfs git tree), I thought I should
give you a heads up....
