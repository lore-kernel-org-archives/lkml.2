Tejun,

I am assuming that these back-to-back flushes are independent of each
other otherwise write request will anyway get between two flushes.

If that's the case, then should we solve the problem by improving flush
merge logic a bit better. (Say idle a bit before issuing a flush only
if request queue is not empty).

That way multiple back to back flushes can be merged without taking a hit on
throughput and we can avoid this special casing whether driver can queue the
flush or not.

Thanks
Vivek
