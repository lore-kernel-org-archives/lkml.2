Do you mean proc connector?  AFAICS, it is available to root only.  And
no, taskstats is not singled out - I mentioned inotify as another
example.  The kernel might be vulnerable to many side channel attacks,
using different interfaces.

Because it notifies _asynchronously_ in sense of the subject and
synchronously in sense of the object's activity.  It gives a hint when
some probable "chechpoint" occured.

Please compare in the example I've posted above the cases of "poll"
(like test -e /proc/$pid) and "wait" (taskstats).  In the poll case it's
very easy to loose the moment of the race because of rescheduling.  In
the wait case the attacker task wakes up very closely to the race place.

Umm...  If both taskstats and procfs expose some sensible information,
both should be fixed, no?

Or the last succeeded measurement didn't happen after some sensible
event.

Introducing this "race" neither fixes some bug or fully prevents some
exploitation technique.  It might _reduce the chance_ of exploitation.

In my ssh exploit an attacker using procfs would have to poll
/proc/PID/io while 2 other processes would run - privileged sshd and
unprivileged sshd.  The scheduler would try to run both sshds
on different CPUs of 2 CPU system in parallel because sshds actively
exchange the data via pipes.  So, the poller might not run on any CPU
while the unpivileged sshd is dying.  By using taskstats I get the
precise information from the first attempt.
