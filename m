How big can that be? could we, maybe, use the sense_buffer, properly allocated
already?

So if the unmap bit is set then the page can just be zero, right?

I still think a static zero-page is a worth while optimization. And
block-drivers can take care with special needs with a private mem_pool
or something. For the discard-type user and generic block layer the
page is just an implementation specific residue, No?

But don't mind me, I'm just babbling. Not that I'll do anything about it.
