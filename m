Nothing, afacit.

I think this was the race which I taunted the mm developers about a
couple of months back (can't find the email) and nobody contradicted
me at that time.

The mechanism is called "luck".  Way back in the 2.5.late days there
was such a bug in the kernel (inode was reclaimed while vmscan was
playing with the address_space) and I was able to trigger oopses from
it.  It required really massive, withering amounts of memory pressure. 
Stupid amounts.  I should dig out those tools and remember how to
operate them...
