It's conventional to identify commits by their title as well as their
hash.  So 17bc6c30cf6bfffd816bdc53682dd46fc34a2cf4 ("vfs: Add
no_nrwrite_index_update writeback control flag").  Because that commit
might have different hashes in different trees, I think.  A Linus idea.

I do this ten times a day - It's a PITA.

'bout time we fixed that.  I wonder why it took so long to find.
