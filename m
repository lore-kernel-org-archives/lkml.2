 From the peanut gallery, I've always set an infinite loop with an 
exponential backoff on the loss of communication.  IE, in some code I 
wrote for S3backer (a FUSE file system on top of Amazon EC3) a few years 
ago (committed by Archie Cobbs).

The trade off is that your applications will try to submit requests if 
you don't tell them "leave me alone, I can't service you now".  The more 
I think about it, the more it seems like failing silently.  Isn't the 
rule supposed to be "if you must fail, do it loudly and as soon as 
possible"?  Just my $0.02.  Take it as you will.
