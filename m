But mke2fs probably is NOT doing a "single big discard", because for SATA the
TRIM command is limited to 64K sectors per range.. and the in-kernel TRIM
code only ever does single ranges..

So doing a discard over an entire drive-encompassing partition, say.. 100GB,
will require 3000+ individual TRIM commands.  At (say) 200msecs each, that
adds up to about ten minutes of execution time.  Or less if the drive is
faster than that.

Whereas.. grouping them into 64-ranges per trim, could reduce the execution
time down to perhaps 1/50th of that, or in the range of 10-20 seconds instead.

Cheers
