I observed the behavior on bd2d0210cf in a qemu-kvm install of
openSUSE 11.3 (x86_64) on *totally* different host - an AMD quad-core.

I did /not/ observe the behavior on 16828088f9 (yet). I'll run the
test a few more times on 1682..

Additionally, I am building a bisected kernel now (
cb20d5188366f04d96d2e07b1240cc92170ade40 ), but won't be able to get
back at it for a while.

I hope this helps.
