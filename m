Actually, no, it wasn't eCryptfs or another stacked filesystem.
It seems my dirty little secret must come out: I hit the problem
when trying to use the (necessarily) out-of-tree zfsonlinux
(ZoL) [1], on an NFS root machine.

I don't know exactly what ZoL is using lookup_one_len() for, nor
how to fix it so it isn't, but I've given them the heads up that
it's not supposed to be used outside of original file system [2].

Chris.
