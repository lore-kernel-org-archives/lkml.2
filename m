I don't think we want to open this can of worms.  We want disjoint
sets if at all possible.  The only reason they weren't disjoint
sets from the get go was because at the time, nobody had any of
the newer boards, and we needed something to test hpsa on.

>From what I've seen of newer distro betas, the udev stuff does seem to
behave pretty nicely nowadays and one can transparently boot up and mount
filesystems and so on despite swapping out cciss for hpsa or vice
versa without any need to fix anything up.  However, there are
issues.  For example, with the newer distro betas I've seen, The module
load order is not deterministic, and esp. tends to differ in the
kdump initrd case vs. the "normal" initrd kernel case.  If you're
running cciss and hpsa with hpsa_allow_any=1 -- or have other
overlapping device support -- then this means you
can't be certain which driver will get which hardware on any given
boot, which, even though udev makes it mostly work transparently,
it's a bit disconcerting if you aren't expecting it to see all your
filesystems suddenly mounted from strange places, to say the least.
In particular, with overlapping device support, I noticed things
likely to swap around when kdump kernel was loading, with the result
being that the kdump didn't work, because the kdump initrd is a bit
stripped down and lacking in features (I forget now *exactly* what
went wrong, but it was due to some diff between kdump initrd and
the normal initrd in the distro I was looking at.)

All this is avoided if there's no overlapping device support
by default.

I was trying to make things match what we have in our (HP's) variant
of the driver.

Which is to say, cciss should contain:

Of course patches to this kind of code tend to be fragile and not have
much of a shelf life.  Sounds like mine had already rotted.
