We should already be flushing the kernel direct mapping after writing by
means of the calls to flush_dcache_page() in xdr_partial_copy_from_skb()
and all the helpers in net/sunrpc/xdr.c.

The only new thing is the read access through the virtual address
mapping. That mapping is created outside the loop in
nfs_readdir_xdr_to_array(), which is why I'm thinking we do need the
invalidate_kernel_vmap_range(): we're essentially doing a series of
writes through the kernel direct mapping (i.e. readdir RPC calls), then
reading the results through the virtual mapping.

i.e. we're doing

ptr = vm_map_ram(lowmem_pages);
while (need_more_data) {

for (i = 0; i < npages; i++) {
addr = kmap_atomic(lowmem_page[i]);
*addr = rpc_stuff;
flush_dcache_page(lowmem_page[i]);
kunmap_atomic(lowmem_page[i]);
}

invalidate_kernel_vmap_range(ptr); // Needed here?

read = *ptr;
}
vm_unmap_ram(lowmem_pages)

Arbitrary sized pages. :-)

The problem here is that we want to read variable sized records (i.e.
readdir() records) from a multi-page buffer. We could do that by copying
those particular records that overlap with page boundaries, but that
would make for a fairly intrusive rewrite too.
