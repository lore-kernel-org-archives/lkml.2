Again, this is subjective, but kref_ looks like the unnecessary
complication to me. But I won't insist, see below.

OK, good.

And xchg(info->complete) implements the simplest counter,
xchg() == NULL is equivalent to atomic_dec_and_test() == T.

But again, again, I won't argue if you send the patch which uses
kref_ instead. I do not maintain this code and I do not really mind.
And I never pretended my taste is good ;)

My point is, this is completely orthogonal to "add the timeout",
and if you want to change the refcounting I'd suggest a separate
patch.

What we need is wait_for_completion_state_timeout() to avoid
the horror like

	if (UMH_KILLABLE && !timeout)
		wait_for_completion_killable(...);
	else if (UMH_KILLABLE && timeout)
		wait_for_completion_killable_timeout(...);
	else if (!UMH_KILLABLE && !timeout)
		...

IOW, I think we need to export wait_for_common() first.

This is the only complication afaics. After that "add the timeout"
becomes almost one-liner, with or without "switch to kref_".

No, afaik

Yes, I think this should work.

Oleg.
