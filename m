Yes, it is redundant but it is simple and works fine as long as I don't
apply the patch to return -EREMOTE for non-terminal dentrys. I'd need to
clear the flag, as below, on non-terminal dentrys if the -EREMOTE patch
is needed.

With one small correction to the autofs patch I've been able to
successfully run the autofs Connectathon parser test without any user
space changes for both the nobrowse (the usual case) and the browse
(pre-created mount point directories) cases. The test consists of 230
mounts, with success and fail cases, for both direct and indirect
mounts. These mounts include various offset mount constructs as well. To
consider the test a success I require the mounts to also expire
correctly.

There are more tests to run, such as the program mount test, and the
often problematic submount test. Also, I have a submount based stress
test.

But, all in all, this is shaping up to be just what I need. Having one
single place to call back to the daemon, where I don't need to play
around with the inode mutex, makes me think this implementation will
finally resolve my deadlock issue with indirect mounts.
