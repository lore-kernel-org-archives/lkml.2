  Yeah, pages submitted by jbd2 don't have writeback flag set because they
are metadata blocks written directly via buffer heads. But as you noted,
these are protected in a different way by the journalling layer so
shouldn't need to worry.

  It's difficult at the block layer... If page->mapping->host is not a
device inode, the page should have PageWriteback set. If it is a device
inode, you don't know - JBD2 will submit pages without PageWriteback set,
flusher thread will submit pages with PageWriteback set. And both is OK
since we use buffer state for synchronization.
