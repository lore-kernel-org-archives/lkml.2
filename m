I was (one of many) people who worked at EMC on designing storage 
arrays. If you are using any high end, external hardware array, it will 
detect data corruption pro-actively for you. Most arrays do continual 
scans for latent errors and have internal data integrity checks that are 
used for this.

Note that DIF/DIX adds an extra 8 bytes of data integrity to newer 
standards disks. We don't do anything with that today in btrfs, but you 
could imagine ways to get even better data integrity protection.

If you are using software RAID (MD), you should also use its internal 
checks to do this kind of proactive detection of latent errors on a 
regular basis (say once every week or two).
