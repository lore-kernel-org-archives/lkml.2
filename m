Yes, exactly.

And the winner is (seemingly):
commit 69c1182c4e5d8b7da772ddad512c6f6b67ec1bb8
Author: Eric Paris <eparis@redhat.com>
Date:   Thu Dec 17 21:24:27 2009 -0500

    fsnotify: vfsmount marks generic functions

    Much like inode-mark.c has all of the code dealing with marks on inodes
    this patch adds a vfsmount-mark.c which has similar code but is intended
    for marks on vfsmounts.

I can't verify it by reverting on the top of -mm as it doesn't revert
cleanly. Do you see any bug in there?

thanks,
