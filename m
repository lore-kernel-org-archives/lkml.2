That's the part I'd like to review carefully and haven't yet.

The one thing I remember not liking before was a flag that told the user
whether a given ACL was originally mapped from POSIX or not.  Is that
still there?

Overall I'm for doing this: I don't like NFSv4/Windows ACLs more than
anyone else, but they're too useful to ignore, and the mapping that
Samba and the NFSv4 server try to do is painful for users.
