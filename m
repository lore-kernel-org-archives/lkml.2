Yes, checking whether it's a transport error in lower layer is
the right solution.
(Since I know it's not available yet, I just hoped if upper layers
 had some other options.)

Anyway, only reporting errors for REQ_FLUSH to upper layer without
such a solution would make dm-multipath almost unusable in real world,
although it's better than implicit data loss.

If it's possible, it could be a workaround for a short term.
But how can you do that?

I think it's not enough to just drop REQ_FLUSH flag from q->flush_flags.
Underlying devices of a mpath device may have write-back cache and
it may be enabled.
So if a mpath device doesn't set REQ_FLUSH flag in q->flush_flags, it
becomes a device which has write-back cache but doesn't support flush.
Then, upper layer can do nothing to ensure cache flush?

Thanks,
Kiyoshi Ueda
