    NFSv4.1: Return NFS4ERR_BADSESSION to callbacks during session resets
    
    If the client is in the process of resetting the session when it receives
    a callback, then returning NFS4ERR_DELAY may cause a deadlock with the
    DESTROY_SESSION call.
    
    Basically, if the client returns NFS4ERR_DELAY in response to the
    CB_SEQUENCE call, then the server is entitled to believe that the
    client is busy because it is already processing that call. In that
    case, the server is perfectly entitled to respond with a
    NFS4ERR_BACK_CHAN_BUSY to any DESTROY_SESSION call.
    
    Fix this by having the client reply with a NFS4ERR_BADSESSION in
    response to the callback if it is resetting the session.

    NFSv4.1: Fix the callback 'highest_used_slotid' behaviour
    
    Currently, there is no guarantee that we will call nfs4_cb_take_slot() even
    though nfs4_callback_compound() will consistently call
    nfs4_cb_free_slot() provided the cb_process_state has set the 'clp' field.
    The result is that we can trigger the BUG_ON() upon the next call to
    nfs4_cb_take_slot().
    
    This patch fixes the above problem by using the slot id that was taken in
    the CB_SEQUENCE operation as a flag for whether or not we need to call
    nfs4_cb_free_slot().
    It also fixes an atomicity problem: we need to set tbl->highest_used_slotid
    atomically with the check for NFS4_SESSION_DRAINING, otherwise we end up
    racing with the various tests in nfs4_begin_drain_session().

    pnfs-obj: Fix the comp_index != 0 case
    
    There were bugs in the case of partial layout where olo_comp_index
    is not zero. This used to work and was tested but one of the later
    cleanup SQUASHMEs broke it and was not tested since.
    
    Also add a dprint that specify those received layout parameters.
    Everything else was already printed.

    pnfs-obj: Bug when we are running out of bio
    
    When we have a situation that the number of pages we want
    to encode is bigger then the size of the bio. (Which can
    currently happen only when all IO is going to a single device
    .e.g group_width==1) then the IO is submitted short and we
    report back only the amount of bytes we actually wrote/read
    and all is fine. BUT ...
    
    There was a bug that the current length counter was advanced
    before the fail to add the extra page, and we come to a situation
    that the CDB length was one-page longer then the actual bio size,
    which is of course rejected by the osd-target.
    
    While here also fix the bio size calculation, in the case
    that we received more then one group of devices.
