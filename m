I'd add a:

	See Documentation/sysctl/fs.txt for details.

line as well.

Naming nit: how about dropping the _NONACCESS/_nonaccess names 
complete and turn it into protected_hardlinks? The longer 
variant is not any better descriptive, and needlessly longer.

The PROTECTED_SYMLINKS/PROTECTED_HARDLINKS naming is thus also 
nicely symmetric.

Small detail: don't these audit methods map to nothing on 
!CONFIG_AUDIT, allowing the #ifdef to be dropped? (if not then 
it should really be so.)

Otherwise:
