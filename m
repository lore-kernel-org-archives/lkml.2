In that case the io error goes to the async page writeback bio-endio
handlers.  We don't have a reference on the inode and no ability to
reliably restart the IO, but we can set a bit on the address space
indicating that somewhere, sometime in the past we had an IO error.

Sorry, how can we tell the errors that are self induced from the evil
bit flipping cable induced errors?
