Right, I understand that.

Not also; instead of.  There's no need for an extra SRB status.  Just
return the standard check condition sense data.

I thought you just said you'd only just asked them if they could
implemented it, in which case no version of windows currently ships with
this, correct?

I'm not sure about that either.  You presumably translate
SRB_STATUS_ERROR into DID_TARGET_FAILURE.  That should cause the
termination of the command with prejudice in exactly the same way as an
ILLEGAL_REQUEST sense code would (minus the useful error information),
so what's causing the boot failure?
