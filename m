  No. Because the process can receive a reply to the write() syscall that
  indicates that the data is safe, but the EKEYEXPIRED error will cause
  the data to be lost when the client tries to actually commit the data to
  disk.

The write() syscall doesn't indicate whether the data is safe or not.  That
would be the close() syscall.
