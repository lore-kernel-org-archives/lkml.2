The versions of the spec change, as do the chapter numbers and table
numbers.  But it is always "SCSI Primary Commands" ( <- the command
set specification), "INQUIRY data" ( <- the SCSI command response which
contains the data that we are talking about here), "Peripheral Device
Type" ( <- the number which is written into the modalias).

In the last draft revisions of SPC-3 and SPC-4 which were openly published
at ftp.t10.org, it is table 83 in section 6.4.2.  (Visit archive.org to
retrieve those drafts.)  But in the words of the same table:  "All
standards are subject to revision, and parties to agreements based on this
standard are encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying the
most recent editions of the listed standards." :-)

But
  - the values come from the target, not from the kernel,
  - their meaning is defined by ANSI/INCITS T10, not by the authors of
    linux/drivers/scsi/scsi.c.

Maybe call it Peripheral Device Type (PDT, defined by SCSI Primary
Commands).
