It would be more convenient if this were part of stat() but adding a
new stat call is non-trivial. Even if we did that, it still doesn't
solve the problem of being able to set the create time. The fact that
that's rarely done doesn't really matter much -- we ought to shoot for
the semantics that are needed to handle this properly.

If we do settle on a xstat() interface, it might also end up being able
to report things like selinux labels which are also available and
settable via xattr. I don't see a problem with presenting the same data
via multiple interfaces. If presenting this data via xattr solves the
immediate problem of being able to properly store and report the create
time then it seems like a win.

If that's the case, don't you have to query for this EA every time you
need to return the create time anyway? If so, then doing this really
isn't any more costly -- you'd just be querying a different EA, right?
