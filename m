Hmm. in short, dirty_ratio in use_hierarchy=1 doesn't work as an user expects.
Is this a spec. or a current implementation ?

I think as following.
 - add a limitation as "At setting chidlren's dirty_ratio, it must be below parent's.
   If it exceeds parent's dirty_ratio, EINVAL is returned."

Could you modify setting memory.dirty_ratio code ?
Then, parent's dirty_ratio will never exceeds its own. (If I understand correctly.)

"memory.dirty_limit_in_bytes" will be a bit more complecated, but I think you can.
