What the MAINTAINERS file says is:

5.	Make a patch available to the relevant maintainer in the list

It doesn't say to send emails only to any appropriate list.

The EXT4 section is:

EXT4 FILE SYSTEM
M:	"Theodore Ts'o" <tytso@mit.edu>
M:	Andreas Dilger <adilger.kernel@dilger.ca>
L:	linux-ext4@vger.kernel.org
W:	http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org
Q:	http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-ext4/list/
S:	Maintained
F:	Documentation/filesystems/ext4.txt
F:	fs/ext4/

The reason get_maintainers by default cc'd signers is mostly
historical.  The file pattern coverage in MAINTAINERS when
it was added wasn't very good, so signers were always added.
It was also the Linus' preferred mechanism to find those
"who really do the work".

http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/14/276

Anyway, the current file pattern coverage is probably
sufficiently good to change the --git default to off, as was
done by this commit already in Andrew Morton's mm tree.

Now git history is used only if there is no specifically
named maintainer.

The current version returns:

$ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl -f fs/ext4/acl.c
"Theodore Ts'o" <tytso@mit.edu>
Andreas Dilger <adilger.kernel@dilger.ca>
linux-ext4@vger.kernel.org
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

cheers, Joe
