OK Thanks I was missing this part. Sorry I only looked at the patches and
not the complete code.

So for pSCSI could you use the cmnd buffer at struct request? Maybe
postpone a little bit the patching of the cdb to after the request allocation.
Than anything bigger then 16 bytes (max cmnd at struct request) you allocate
and free on request completion.
But all that could be cleaned up later. You are currently busy with bigger
stuff, just as a future note.

The rest look good. I have some holes in my knowledge of how you did bidi.
I promise to one of these days actually clone the tree and look at the real
code.
My goal is to have Lio-iscsi => lio-pSCSI => iscsi-initiator as a passthrough
of OSD commands. That will prove things are done right.

Also a Lio-iscsi => lio-tgt_if => tgtd-user-mode should also be very useful
and OSD-able

Thanks, Nic. Hope you feeling better now
Boaz
