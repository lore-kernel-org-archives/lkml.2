More or less yes.

Not for UNMAP.  WRITE SAME in it's various incarnations uses the
standard LBA/LEN encoding and you seem to parse it nicely.  But for
UNMAP the lba/len pairs are in the command payload.  To support things
genericly you'd need a standard way to pass them.  If you want to
limit yourself to one lba/len pair for one the scheme could work,
though.

blk_issue_discard is in no way generic.  It's 100% iblock code and
really doesn't belong into any other backend.  And btw,
blk_issue_discard is rather suboptimal even in iblock - it's a
synchronous function that will stall progress of the thread handling it.
If you want better performance you'll need to opencode the content of
it to allow an asynchronous completion handler.  But given that discard
isn't really a critical feature at this point this could easily be
left for later with a comment.

Right now there is no good way to do a block device discard or file
hole punch at the level where the file backend operates.
