Thanks for your reply and sorry for the slow response. As my system
also experienced lockups from time to time I performed an extensive
memtest run, which actually brought up sporadic memory corruption
(some bits flipping to zero) after 20 hours or so. I swapped CPU,
mainboard and RAM and have not experienced any problems since then, so
I guess this was the cause of the issue.

Thanks,
Thilo
