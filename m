The analogy of mount looping and ESTATE loop is a bit of a stretch IMHO... 
With mount looping the server has not responded so it make sense to wait for a response (aka the first response). With ESTALE looping the server has actively remove something the client has been working with... I see those as two different events so they need to be handled differently...

If looping is going to be involved in ESTALE handling then a time based loop does make more sense than a simple for loop.. IMHO... Similar to Jeff's version 2 patch... 

steved.
