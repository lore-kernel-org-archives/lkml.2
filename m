My concern is simple: virtio_blk covers the 99% of cases, with very
little complexity.  To get that last 1%, we will end up re-specing much
of SCSI.

Having found someone who understand SCSI and is eager to maintain a
driver and spec, I am deeply tempted to partition the problem as simple
== virtio_blk, complex == virtio_scsi.

In fact, it would allow us to tighten the spec on VIRTIO_BLK_T_SCSI_CMD
to its actual use, which AFAICT is CDROMEJECT (maybe CDROMCLOSETRAY).

Cheers,
Rusty.
