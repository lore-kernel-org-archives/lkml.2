  Thanks. I had a look at it. It seems that it's really the HTREE code
that's causing problems. When a directory is using HTREEs, it should contain
directory entries in some hash range in each block. Say entries with hash
0-0xabcd1234 in block 0, entries with hash 0xabcd1235-0xffffffff in block
1. But the corrupted directories do not obey this rule. In particular e.g.
block 1 should contain entries with hashes 0-0x2fac6780 but it contains
lots of entries with hash larger than 0x2fac6780. I've spent quite some
time looking into the code and I'm not yet sure how that could happen.
  My first suspect would be code splitting blocks when a block gets full.
The code allocates new block for a directory, then inside the buffer
creates an array of

struct dx_map_entry
{
        u32 hash;
        u16 offs;
        u16 size;
};

entries describing entries in the block to split. Then this array is
sorted, we find a place to split and copy appropriate entries to the new
block and compact the old block.
  In the binary dump of one of corrupted directories, I've found the built
array:

<next directory block starts>

If you look at the array more in detail, you'll notice that 'offs' part of
structure is sometimes identical. That should never happen because 'offs'
contains offset of the corresponding directory entry in a block. So when
offsets are identical in this array, subsequent move will copy some entries
several times and leave entries that should be moved in the old block,
resulting in a corruption we see.
  The question is, how could offsets be the same? dx_make_map seems to get
it right and dx_sort_map as well. Maybe I'd peek into disassembly of
dx_sort_map to see whether swap() macro does what it should... If that
looks OK, you could try adding some debug checks into dx_sort_map and try
to catch the moment when duplicate offsets are created...
