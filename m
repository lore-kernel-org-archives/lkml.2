Well, there's IOCB_CMD_FSYNC.  But still, this isn't the same thing as
what's requested.  If I understand correctly, what is requested is a
mechanism to flush out all data for multiple file descriptors and follow
that with a single barrier/flush (and yes, Ted did give a summary of the
commands that would be required to accomplish that).

There still remains the question of why this should be tied to the AIO
submission interface.


Cheers,
