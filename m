Just a note, one thing that we have been doing is trying to get a reasonable 
regression test in place for testing data integrity. That might be useful to 
share as we float patches around barrier changes.

Basic test:

(1) Get a box with an external e-sata (or USB) connected drive

(2) Fire off some large load on that drive (Chris Mason had one, some of our QE 
engineers have been using fs_mark (fs_mark -d /your_fs/test_dir -S 0 -t 8 -F)

(3) Pull the power cable to that external box.

Of course, you can use any system and drop power, but the above setup will make 
sure that we kill the write cache on the device without letting the firmware 
destage the cache contents.

The test passes if you can now do the following:

(1) Mount the file system without error

(2) Unmount and force an fsck - that should run without reporting errors as well.

Note that the above does not use fsync in the testing.

Thanks!

Ric
