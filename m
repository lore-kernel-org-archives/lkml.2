I've been more-or-less assuming that's me, not that I've been doing much
real maintenance to speak of.

Yep.

With no more -rc, and no chance to test anything myself till I'm back
from the holidays, my preference would be for Linus to merge the
already-posted one-liner.  Then I can queue up the below for 3.3.

commit 72acf27f6c20573d555d6b4450a7a9d41c4c9d5a
Author: J. Bruce Fields <bfields@redhat.com>

    locks: simplify allocation in break_lease
    
    The code bends over backwards to avoid returning -ENOMEM in cases where
    the allocation wasn't really necessary.
    
    But there's nothing really *wrong* with returning -ENOMEM in those
    cases: break_lease callers can already return -ENOMEM for other reasons.
    So let's not take so much trouble over a rare case, and keep the code
    simpler.
