The problem with not issuing a cache flush when you have dirty meta data or data 
is that it does not have any tie to the state of the volatile write cache of the 
target storage device.

We do need to have fsync() issue the cache flush command even when there is no 
dirty state for the inode in our local page cache in order to flush data that 
was pushed out/cleaned and not followed by a flush.

It would definitely be *very* useful to have an array of fd's that all need 
fsync()'ed at home time....
