I don't think it's necessary to worry about journal=data mode.  First
of all, it's not true that all of the I/O would be prioritized as
metadata.  In data=journal mode, data blocks are written twice; once
to the journal, and once to the final location on disk.  And the
journal writes do need to be prioritized because the commit can't go
out until all of the preceeding journal blocks have been written.  So
treating all of the journal writes as metadata for the the purposes of
cfq's prioritization makes sense to me....
