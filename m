For dget - mntget, there are several such code. For example,
nameidata_dentry_drop_rcu()
{
	struct dentry *parent = nd->path.dentry;
		:::
	parent->d_count++;
	spin_unlock(&dentry->d_lock);
	spin_unlock(&parent->d_lock);
		:::
	mntget(nd->path.mnt);
		:::

But I am not sure the "get" order is a problem.
Nick Piggin also replied and said dget and mntget is not a problem, and
I replied if I found such "put" order, I would write again.
