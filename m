I think it would be better to be a little more specific here.  Instead 
of "acquires a runtime PM reference", say "calls 
pm_runtime_get_noresume()".  Or at least, say "increments the 
run-time usage counter".

Likewise, instead of "disables the runtime PM framework", say "calls 
pm_runtime_disable()" or at least "increments power.disable_depth".

Hmmm, come to think of it...  The documentation for pm_runtime_enable() 
and pm_runtime_disable() fails to mention power.disable_depth, which is 
a surprising omission.  In particular, the description of 
pm_runtime_enable() is wrong because it ignores the possibility of 
nested disables.
