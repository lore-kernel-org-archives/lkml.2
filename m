Indeed. And I dd the semantic merge differently from what you had
done, more like what Al did for XFS in commit 765927b2d508 (see the
fairly equivalent case in fs/xfs/xfs_ioctl.c).

IOW, instead of doing the unnecessary mntget() (and then undoing it
with the path_put()), I just let dentry_open() get the references it
needs, and then just dput() the dentry in the caller (to match the
dget() done by d_obtain_alias()). No need to mess with the mnt
refcounts, since dentry_open() will get whatever refcount it needs.

But while it compiles, I haven't actually *tested* the btrfs
BTRFS_IOC_SEND send/receive path, so please do double-check my merge.
