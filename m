Whoops..  Missed one extra target/pscsi regression bug-fix reported
recently by Alex Elsayed (CC'ed) that has just been pushed into master
here:

target/pscsi: Fix bug with REPORT_LUNs handling for SCSI passthrough
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/nab/target-pending.git;a=commitdiff;h=1d2a2cd95ee0137a2353d1b5635739c281f27cd4

Alex-E, you where able to get TYPE_ROM passthrough w/ pSCSI export
working on your setup with this patch, yes..?

Thanks!
