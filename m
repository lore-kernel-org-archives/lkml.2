Your stack trace is showing v4 calls on the failing box, those definitely shouldn't be happening if you're using v3.  Can you double check /etc/fstab and /proc/mounts on a working kernel to be sure?

My VM has nfs as a module, so I don't think that's the issue... I just started compiling your config to test on my own.
