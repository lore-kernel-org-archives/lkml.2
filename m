This only works for drivers which are struct request based.  For those
that handle struct bio directly, nr_pending will always be 0.

I think the right place to increment nr_pending is in generic_make_request.
But I'm not sure where to decrement it.  I think we need a blk_bio_endio()
which does some housekeeping and then calls bio_endio().
