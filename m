OK, that's what I hadn't seen.  I can't think of another way we could
fail at the moment, except in suspend/resume because the
scsi_complete_async_scans will be a nop. Can someone test the
suspend/resume case?


There is actually one good thing to come out of this:  Rafael's commit

commit c751085943362143f84346d274e0011419c84202

    PM/Hibernate: Wait for SCSI devices scan to complete during resume

Actually broke the scsi_wait_scan module, because for modular SCSI
(which is effectively all distributions) its scsi_complete_async_scans()
is also a nop.  I assume this means that no distributions rely on it any
more and we can remove it?

I appreciate this is a bug, but it's not quite as serious as breaking
suspend and hibernate ... can we demonstrate they're still working?
