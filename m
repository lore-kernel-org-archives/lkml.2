Memory for acl2 comes from the stack, which contains arbitrary data when this function is invoked.  The areas between the structure fields are not affected by the variable assignments used here.  If the data in acl2 is then simply memcpy'd to the XDR buffer, that old stack data can possibly appear on the wire.

I think in that regard we are also safe, if the array encoding operates by data type rather than by simply doing a blanket memcpy.  See xdr_nfsace_encode().  It's always possible I misunderstood how ACEs are XDR encoded.

I mean memset() of course.
