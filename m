This is a course correction for the user namespace, so that we can reach
an inexpensive, maintainable, and reasonably complete implementation.

If anyone can think of a reason why the user namespace should not
evolve in the direction taken in this patchset please let me know.

There is not an obvious maintainer for the scope of what this patchset
covers so I intend to host this tree myself and to place it in
linux-next after this round of review.

Highlights.
- The kernel will now fail to build if you attempt to compile in
  code whose permission checks have not been updated to be user
  namespace safe.

- All uids from child user namespaces are mapped into the initial user
  namespace before they are processed.  Removing the need to add
  an additional check to see if the user namespace of the compared
  uids remains the same.

- With the user namespaces compiled out the performance is as good or
  better than it is today.

- For most operations absolutely nothing changes performance or
  operationally with the user namespace enabled.

- The worse case performance I could come up with was timing 1 billion
  cache code stat operations with the user namespace code enabled.  This
  went from 156s to 164s on my laptop (or 156ns to 164ns per stat
  operation).

- (uid_t)-1 and (gid_t)-1 are reserved as an internal error value.
  Most uid/gid setting system calls treat these value specially anyway
  so attempting to use -1 as a uid would likely cause entertaining
  failures in userspace.

- If setuid is called with a uid that can not be mapped setuid fails.
  I have looked at sendmail, login, ssh and every other program I could
  think of that would call setuid and they all check for and handle
  the case where setuid fails.

- If stat or a similar system call is called from a context in which we
  can not map a uid we lie and return overflowuid.  The LFS experience
  suggests not lying and returning an error code might be better, but
  the historical precedent with uids is different and I can't figure out
  what would break by lying about a uid we can't map.

- Capabilities are localized to the current user namespace making
  it safe to give the initial user in a user namespace all capabilities.

This patchset covers all the modifications needed to convert the core
kernel and make enough other bits to make a bootable result.

These patches are against linux-3.4-rc1 and are also available at:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace.git master

An essentially complete conversion of the entire kernel is available at:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace.git userns-always-map-user-v26
I have reviewed the additional patches less stringently.  The diffstat
