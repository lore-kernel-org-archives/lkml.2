The really was a pretty basic bug.  It's writeback 101 to test that case :(

This is somewhat inefficient.  It's really trivial and fast to find the
highest-index dirty page by walking straight down the
PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY-tagged nodes.

However pagevec_lookup_tag(..., PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY) should do a pretty
good job of skipping over the (millions of) pages between the (last
dirty page before `end') and (`end').  So it _should_ be OK.  Some thought
and runtime testing would be good.



That being said, I think the patch is insufficient.  If I create an
enormous (possibly sparse) file with a 16TB hole (or a run of clean
pages) in the middle and then start busily writing into that hole (run
of clean pages), the problem will still occur.

One obvious fix for that (a) would be to add another radix-tree tag and
do two passes across the radix-tree.

Another fix (b) would be to track the number of dirty pages per
adddress_space, and only write that number of pages.

Another fix would be to work out how the code handled this situation
before we broke it, and restore that in some fashion.  I guess fix (b)
above kinda does that.
