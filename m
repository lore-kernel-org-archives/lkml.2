But that is not even a real reason, is it ? When you need snapshots,
well, then you just need it and do no want to get rid of it. When fs
corruption appears, then it's bad in any case and the fsck should be
able to more or less fix it.

So you're saying that when corruption appears, then you *have to* blast
all snapshots ? I am not sure how btrfs is going to deal with it, but it
does seem like an advantage at all, why are you presenting it as such ?

I believe that you just missed the fact that not everyone has attended LSF
and your lightning talk, but that's ok.

It seems to me that random writes are usually faster with you snapshot
code regardless whether you use snapshots or not. Is that because of
non snapshot related changes you've made ?

Also random reads seems to be slower with snapshots, is suspect that
this is because of read through, so the reason for the slowdown that it
was CPU bound ? I do not see any CPU utilization data.

The postmark results seems quite odd, it is actually a lot faster with
one snapshot and a lot slower with multiple snapshots, do you have an
idea what is going on ?

Nevertheless, I still have not seen any comparison with other
snapshotting possibilities we have. Note that ext4 to btrfs comparison
is not enough, because we do not know what is the difference between
the difference of ext4 with/without snapshots and btrfs with/without
snapshots. The reason for this is that btrfs performance is very likely
to scale up, but ext4 is pretty much done in that matter and I do not
expect any huge performance leaps in the future.

Also, rejecting dm-multisnap based on this statement is not enough, show
us some numbers.

I believe that it is not very convenient for you, because this feature
support your business case and you do not necessarily want to find out
that there might be a better way, especially after the work you have
done already.

So it might be unpleasant for you that people ask questions and delaying
the inclusion of ext4 snapshots. But what you see as obstacles people
are throwing at you is really just caution, especially when it comes to
ext4 which is seen as a simple, stable, reliable and predictable linux
filesystem, but I bet you understand.

And one last note, I also think that the snapshot format change in the
future, when we'll have snpashots with 64bit feature compatible seems
just wrong to me. Adding some features or changing the implementation a
bit is ok, but format change is different. When the code is upstream and
stable it is just wrong.

Thanks!
