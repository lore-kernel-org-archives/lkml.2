Why?  No, we don't, unless I am missing something.

Definitely.  In case execve() fails because of the limit, the flag
remains set, so a second execve() by the process will fail too.

Great.  Just to clarify my own words: on fork(), clear the flag in the
child process only.

Here's my take on it:

1. It is not known (from the discussion so far) whether Android/Zygote
even cares about RLIMIT_NPROC specifically or not.  The code is very
generic, usable for any rlimits, and the rationale behind it might have
been to be able to apply certain other limits.  I don't know whether or
not there exists a system that actually sets RLIMIT_NPROC via that
mechanism and expects it working.

2. If desired, Android/Zygote will be able to check the
PF_NPROC_EXCEEDED flag, via procfs or via a prctl() interface that we
might introduce.  Or it may simply pass an extra fork().

This sounds too hackish to me, although if others are (unexpectedly) OK
with it, I don't mind.

Thanks,
