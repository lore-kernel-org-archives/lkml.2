Actually, the corresponding list macro looks like this:

	list_for_each_entry(pos, head, member)

With 'pos' being the equivalent of 'tpos' in the hlist macros (the type *).
Changing hlist macro will make them both look as follows:

	hlist_for_each_entry(pos, head, member)
	list_for_each_entry(pos, head, member)

So following this suggesting will actually bring them back to sync...

The only issue I can see is that as you've said, they're used almost everywhere,
so doing something to change that will require some coordination.


Thanks,
Sasha
