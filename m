struct block_device *bdget(dev_t dev)
{
...
        inode = iget5_locked(blockdev_superblock, hash(dev),
                        bdev_test, bdev_set, &dev);

The device is used by bdev_test and bdev_set.

Oof.  I was using cscope and it didn't show all callers.

OK, thanks for the review, Al, it's greatly appreciated.  Do you have a
suggestion on how I might achieve this in a way that would be
acceptable?  I'm not too fond of the idea of reallocating the inode when
the device does appear.  I'll give it some more thought.

Again, thanks for taking a look.

Cheers,
Jeff
