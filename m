Lots of problems here.

- Two of the patches had the same title ("SCSI: Support several
  features in arcmsr driver").  Please ensure that each patch has a
  unique and well-chosen title.

- application/octet-stream attachments are hard for people to read
  in-line in mail clients.  Please at least use text/plain MIME type if
  possible.

- The patches aren't in `patch -p1' form.  You had

	--- arcmsr/arcmsr_attr.c
	+++ arcmsr.1.20.00.15-81103/arcmsr_attr.c

  which cannot be applied from the top-level of the kernel tree.  It
  should have been

	--- a/drivers/scsi/arcmsr/arcmsr_attr.c
	+++ a/drivers/scsi/arcmsr/arcmsr_attr.c

  or similar.

I got all that fixed up, but when applying the second patch (using
2.6.34-rc4) I encountered a large number of patch rejects and gave up.

So please fix all that up and resend.  Perhaps you could use
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt which automates all this.

Also, please run scripts/checkpatch.pl across the patches - it reports
rather a lot of minor issues which you might choose to address.

Thanks.
