Once we trigger once without dm-crypt, dm-crypt is off the hook.  Just
to verify, when you say without luks, you mean without any crypto bits
in use at all on the filesystems postgres uses?

Usually the trick to reproducing filesystem corruptions is adding memory
pressure.  The corruption is probably a bad interaction between reads
and writes, and we need to make sure the reads actually happen.

http://oss.oracle.com/~mason/pin_ram.c

gcc -Wall -o pin_ram pin_ram.c

pin_ram -m 80%-of-your-ram-in-mb

The idea is to trigger constant reads without having to swap heavily.
80% might be too much.
