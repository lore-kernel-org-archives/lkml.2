  Thanks for the detailed analysis. This is indeed a genuine bug. While
fixing some fsync issues I introduced (or better didn't fix) this problem.
The culprit is that we forget to update i_datasync_tid when we change only
inode size. Thus inode is not forced to disk during fdatasync(). I will send
fixes for this in a moment.
