And no, I don't want to trigger a uevent, Kay pointed out where this
will go very wrong very quickly if this is done.

Douglas pointed out that those tools look in /dev/ which would not work
properly for this type of thing.

Renaming is something that we do NOT want to do, as we have learned our
lesson of the network device renaming mess.  And as Kay pointed out, we
already have an "alias" name there, which no one uses.

So again, I really don't like this, just fix the userspace tools to map
the proper device name that the kernel is using to the userspace name
the tool used, and all is fine.  This has been done already today,
succesfully, by many of the big "enterprise" monitoring systems that
work quite well on Linux, proving that this is not something that the
kernel needs to provide to implement properly.
