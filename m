One could glibly answer yes to this.  However, the fact is that it's
currently SCSI which manages the queue, so SCSI cleans it up.  Now, the
only real thing dm is interested in is the queue itself, hence the need
to take a reference to the queue.  However, queue references don't pin
SCSI devices, so you can hold a queue reference all you like and SCSI
will still clean up the queue.

I think a better question is what should cleaning up the queue do?  SCSI
uses it to indicate that we're no longer processing requests, which
happens when the device goes into a DEL state, but queue cleanup tears
down the elevators and really makes the request queue non functional.
In this case, holding a reference isn't particularly helpful.

I'm starting to wonder if there's actually any value to
blk_cleanup_queue() and whether its functionality wouldn't be better
assumed by the queue release function on last put.

For the model, these need to be independent but related.  Trying to
subordinate one to the other is going to lead to layering problems.
