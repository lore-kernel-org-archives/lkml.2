I didn't know that aspect of it.  It will be nice to plug this race -
it's been there for so long because nobody was able to think of an
acceptable way of fixing it by direct means (synchronous locking,
refcounting, etc).  Taking a ref on the inode doesn't work, because we
can't run iput_final() in direct-reclaim contexts (lock ordering snafus).

vmscan is the problematic path - I _think_ all other code paths which
remove pagecache have an inode ref.  But this assumes that
inode->i_mapping points at inode->i_data!  Need to think about the
situation where it points at a different inode's i_data - in that case
these callers may have a ref on the wrong inode.

Actually I was able to hit the race back in late 2.5 or thereabouts. 
Really massive memory pressure caused vmscan->icache_shrinker to free
the inode/address_space while another CPU in vmscan was playing with the
address_space.  That was quite a debugging session ;)
