Yeah, I think that's the way to go.

They are going to look the same at the VFS level and higher.

The current version of whiteout support always hides DT_WHT dentries
from userspace.  Perhaps a start is to only hide DT_WHT entries when
the file system is union mounted.  Applications usually ignore all
dentries with d_ino == 0 so it might not cause problems.

Right now, you have to remove whiteouts offline using fsck.

Bleah!  Then you have a code path that is only tested when you hit
LINK_MAX.  Sounds like a recipe for bugs for me.
