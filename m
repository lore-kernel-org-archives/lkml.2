Could you explain, what are you proposing?
I still don't know any details about it.

Probably I don't understand you, but as I see it now, symlink to "/proc/self/" 
is unacceptable because of the following:
1) will be used current context (any) instead of desired one
1) if CT has other pid namespace - then we just have broken link.
