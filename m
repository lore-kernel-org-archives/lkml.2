Hi,

This bug still exists in 3.1.0 and 3.2.0-rc5

I spoted it again few days ago, because I moved from me laptop with 2GB
to temporary desktop with 256MB of RAM, and not it
triggers like a mad.

So my initial suspicious that it only shows up on big memory
presure was correct.


It is just like this
