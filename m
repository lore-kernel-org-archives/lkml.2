Uh, I don't think TCM_Loop and scst_local are exactly comparable at this
point.  TCM_Loop supports high level multi-fabric WWPN emulation that
allows it to work transparently with inter-nexus SPC-4 PR operation.
Therefore, using TCM_Loop, STGT userspace fabrics now support both PR
and ALUA emulation from TCM_Loop LUNs.  This is done at struct
config_group_ops->make_group() time to report $PROTO_IDENT and the
necessary WWPN info to TCM Core logic.  TCM_Loop also uses the fabric
indepent configfs handlers for pretty much all of it's control plane
code.

I really have no idea what you are talking about 'behind closed doors'..

Have you not been watching the amount of TCM/LIO patches on the
linux-scsi list for the last 18 months..?

I find it hard to beleive you are actually going to agrue against a git
workflow for a target mode subsystem maintainer, well considering that
git was made by a linux kernel maintainer (Linus) for distributed linux
kernel development (everybody else)..?

Again, I suggest you watch the Russian translation of that talk on
youtube and really understand what he means, aside from the insults to
subversion users.

Again, from above how it benefits users:

1) a userspace library in intrepted languages and 2) create high level
applications using said userspace libraries that allow compatiblity to
be contained in the lib below.

2) create high level applications using said userspace libraries that
allow compatiblity to be contained in the lib.

Uhhh, I don't think so.  Aside from your obvious project workflow
issues, the fact that SCST completly lacks a proper user-space driven
representation of parent / child relationships between kernel level data
structures in a fabric independent manner, while still allow for fabric
dependent groups and attributes is a most definately show-stopper for
me.
