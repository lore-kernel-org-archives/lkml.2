Yes. While a write I/O is being processed in Linux or in flight, the
data buffers can change. This causes problems for other checksums as
well; i ran into this when looking at the DIF/DIX checksums for SCSI
commands.

At the moment, this problem can be avoided e.g. by running only direct
I/O on the xfs filesystem. There have been discussions about this, a
short summary is here, look for "stable pages":
