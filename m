The kernel team has been coding around some Utopian SSD TRIM
implementation for at least 2 years with the basic assumption that
SSDs can handle thousands of trims per second.  Just mix em in with
the rest of the i/o.  No problem.  Intel swore to us its the right
thing to do.

I'm still waiting to see the first benchmark report from anywhere
(SSD, Thin Provisioned SCSI) that the online approach used by mount -o
discard is a win performance wise.  Linux has a history of designing
for reality, but for some reason when it comes to SSDs reality seems
not to be a big concern.
