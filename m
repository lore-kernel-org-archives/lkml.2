I disagree that conversion of 'demo mode' struct se_node_acls to explict
userspace syscall driven configfs registered struct
se_node_acl->acl_group is overly complex, or otherwise difficult in
context of a configfs consumer for a transition demo mode -> explict
NodeACL via:

mkdir -p /sys/kernel/config/target/$FABRIC/$WWN/$TPGT/acls/$INITIATOR_WWPN.

Note the current v4.0 code supports this for LIO-Target and TCM/FC
fabric module code, and will just work 'out of the box' for v4.0
compatible fabric modules using target_core_fabric_configfs.c logic.

As for statistics point, this is also currently handled by TCM in struct
se_node_acl in target_core_mib.c:scsi_auth_intr_seq_show() for both
explict NodeACL and TPG context 'demo-mode' generated struct se_node_acl
attached to a struct se_portal_group fabric endpoint.

I think the question is more along the lines of: does sysfs have a hard
requirement for target mode using native TCM/ConfigFS logic.?.  Early in
the development of TCM/LIO v3.0 I thought that driving creation of
configfs struct_groups from kernel code was in fact useful for my own
development and for future mainline code, but with the help of foresight
of jlbec, gregkh and others with our modern v4.0 code I am no longer
convinced we need any direct kernel level interaction between native
v4.0 target mode configfs code and existing sysfs code.

So far using interpreted userspace python/shell code has served this
purpose really quite well in terms of interaction between target mode
configfs and existing sysfs design, and I do not currently see any
inherient limitations from a userspace code driven persective for a full
native configfs target implementation.  I would be happy to be proven
wrong on this point, but so far the original decision to drive target
mode completely from userspace with native configfs code has in fact
proven to be a better decision than a hybrid kernel level configfs +
sysfs implementation from the perspective of the userspace developer
driving /sys/kernel/config/target/* code.

So on this basis I am currently not interested in moving TCM/LIO code
away from a native configfs control plane for the v4.0 release, but I am
happy to discuss positive benefits that a hybrid implementation can
potentially provide to our existing TCM/LIO userspace ecosystem.

Best,
