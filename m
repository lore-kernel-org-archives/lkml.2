I'd prefer generic flags are not dependent on fixed values from a
specific filesystem several layers down the storage stack.

Also, if the problem you are trying to solve is overhead of
calculating the flags for stat() on RISC architectures, then I'd
argue that XFS is just as important target for such an optimisation
because it is widely used in small ARM and MIPS based NAS
appliances....

Cheers,

Dave.
