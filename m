Doesn't that violate POSIX? rename(2) is supposed to be atomic, and I
can't see where there's any exception for that for directories.

Seems like it ought to be possible to eliminate that race for other
filesystems as well, by turning those into an ESTALE return and
retrying again.

Per-name operations for things like getattr and setattr would be nice.
It would also make things cleaner on CIFS since there'd be less
conversion from dentry to path.

Note that we would still need to do a lookup. We have to update the
inode attributes with these operations too. But, that would likely
avoid the ESTALE problems with NFS since we could retry within
the lower fs itself.

That said, there's more than just those two operations involved. We'd
need similar ones for other inode operations too:

readlink
permission
*xattr

...and probably others, especially if you want to allow for more
resilient create/delete in the face of a stale directory.
