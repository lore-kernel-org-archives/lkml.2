We want room for the extent and the inode item and the inode backref.
It's a rough number that leaves some extra room.  But even with a 2K
item we're getting very close to 50% usage of the metadata area.

Correct, but it was in the first or last slot when it was balanced (I
confirmed this with printk).

Then the higher layers were balanced and our leaves were no longer in
the first/last slot.  We don't rebalance leaves when we balance level 1.
