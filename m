To make sure I understand, that should be "shortcut" for a lookup of the
cwd?

So I guess the concern is that you'd do the above and get a successful
lookup since you're just going to get back the cwd. At that point,
you'd attempt the getattr and get ESTALE back. Then, you'd redo the
lookup with LOOKUP_REVAL set -- but since we're operating on the
cwd, we don't have a way to redo the lookup since we don't have a
pathname that we can look up again...

So yeah, I guess if you're sitting in a stale directory, something like
that could loop eternally.

Do you think the proposed check for fatal_signal_pending is enough to
mitigate such a problem? Or do we need to limit the number of retries
to address those sorts of loops?
