It is either/or choice. If the interface isn't fixed NOW, the existing 
flawed zeroed-page-allocation interface gets into RHEL and I and others 
will have to support it for 7 years.

OK, but before you do this research, fix the interface.

You misunderstand what I meant. You admit that there are design problems 
in SCSI. So don't burden other developers with these problems. Don't force 
the others to allocate dummy pages just because you want a cleaner scsi 
code.

You intend to fix the design of SCSI and then remove the dummy pages. But 
by the time you finish it, it will be already late and there will be 
midlayer drivers allocating these dummy pages.

What I mean is that "layering violation" inside one driver is smaller 
problem than misdesigned interface between drivers. So accept the patch 
that creates "layering violation" but cleans up the interface.
