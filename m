[ answered in a different reply, btrfs is faster in everything except
delete ]

The btrfs readdir uses an index that is much more likely to be
sequential on disk than ext.  This makes the readdir more sequential and
it makes the actual file IO more sequential because we're reading things
in the order they were created instead of (random) htree index order.

But, the consistent benchmarking part is really important.  We shouldn't
put an aged ext4 up against a fresh mkfs.btrfs.  Did you do ext4
comparisons on a fresh copy?
