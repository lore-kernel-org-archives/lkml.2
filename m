An SBP-2 initiator should be prepared to retry its first login attempt if
it sent it shortly after a bus reset.  The target may still hold
reservations for previously loggend in initiators for up to reconnect_hold
+ 2 seconds after bus reset.

Yep.

Technically there are two things to perform:

 1. Finish the inbound IEEE 1394 transaction to the management agent
    register by means of fw_send_response().  As far as I can tell, you
    don't have to do that in the address_callback().  But there is little
    reason not to.

    fw_send_response() ends the lifetime of an fw_request, so read the
    speed code before you respond.

 2. Finish the inbound SBP-2 transaction; here the login.  This and
    everything that leads up to it is definitely easiest to implement in
    a process context, e.g. workqueue item.
