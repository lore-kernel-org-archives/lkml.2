This is an important one, as using w/o TMR_* prefixed definitions for
task management response/response defs, we run into problems with
existing include/scsi/scsi.h message codes.

Yes, these others are minor items that have been submitted by people
(hch, roland, jesper, danc) who have been reviewing target code since it
was merged for .38-rc1.

Considering how minor these are I would prefer to have these merged,
than deferring for-39.  If not, then I will need to respin tree w/o
their cleanups if what you prefer to be sent to Linus for-38, there are
3 other bugfix patches in the upstream LIO tree that I have been saving
for-38-rc5 since for-38-rc4 was cut(considering the two outstanding
series).  I would like to have these included as well.

Do you want me to send them all to the linux-scsi list again...?
