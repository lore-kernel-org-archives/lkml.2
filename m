At the time I've started this thread
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.nfs/40863
I had the feeling that the readdir cache changings in 2.6.37 have 
something to do with these loop problems.

After that thread I've accepted that's a general problem with 
ext4/dirindex and nfs but seeing it again on xfs with just 5000 files 
I'm in doubt again.
