Yes; that would only be practical if the device server knows the pattern
(e.g., all ones) that it will return for reads of unmapped LBAs. It's not
very useful if the pattern is simply the last content and could differ
for every LBA.

For consumer SSDs, the data returned for unmapped (i.e. trimmed)
LBAs didn't really matter.

For SSDs to be used in RAID arrays, however:
a) non-deterministic data is unworkable (RAID parity would never be right);
b) deterministic data can be accommodated, but the RAID stack needs to read the
LBA after unmapping to see what pattern resulted and recalculate parity, hurting
performance; and
c) deterministic zeros are ideal (0 XOR n = n).
