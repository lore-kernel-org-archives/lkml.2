AFAICT, this recreates existing problem with /proc/<pid>/fd (see
discussion at 

http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/507386/30/0/threaded

). It creates object that looks like symlink, but does not behave as
one, and permissions of directories are not checked as they would be
if it was a symlink.
