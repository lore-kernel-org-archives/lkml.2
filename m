The two CD-ROM related traces which I posted seem to indicate a bug
between block layer's and SCSI core lifetime managements, rather than in
the cd-rom code particularly.  When I get the time, I will try the
"1. open(), 2. remove device, 3. ioctl()" sequence on an sd_mod device
instead of an sr_mod one and see where this goes.

I don't know what my two traces tell us what particularly is broken and
where to attack the problem.

In case of the sd_revalidate_disk oops from the thread which I highjacked
(which refers to "[PATCH] SCSI/sd: Fix NULL dereference in
sd_revalidate_disk", http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.scsi/71174), the
trouble is that nobody came up with an answer to James' question on how it
could happen in the first place that sd_revalidate_disk(disk) could be
called on a disk that leads to a NULL scsi_disk.  In turn, this presumably
means among else that the answer to my earlier question --- what prevents
the scsi_disk to go invalid slightly after that newly added NULL pointer
check --- cannot be answered yet either.

However, I do think that the pitiful state of block device unplugging
throughout circa a whole year indicates a fundamental problem indeed.  But
I am only familiar with one of the SCSI transport layer drivers, not with
the kernel layers above, so what do I know.

AFAIU it is not clear whether this patch actually prevents dereference of
an invalid sdkp or only makes it considerably more unlikely.

In either case, since there is apparently an underlying issue that this
patch does not address, it is a judgment call whether such a patch is
allowed into a kernel --- distributor kernel or mainline kernel.  If
somebody takes it, then at least a FIXME comment should be put there that
sd_revalidate_disk is supposed to rely on an always valid sdkp.

Sounds like both "your" and "my" bug occur at the end of the sequence

    1. open(), 2. remove device, 3. ioctl() or whatever

though perhaps with the extra twist in your case that this has to happen
before the device bring-up was entirely finished...?  In my CD-ROM related
case the bug is not timing-sensitive at all; it always happens with above
sequence.
