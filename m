It looks like it is not done 100% kosher and calling memdup_user should
be better.

- For 1 memdup_user does a GFP_KERNEL with a comment on how copy_from_user
  would eventually sleep, so what's the point of GFP_ATOMIC?
  If this is by design then it surly calls for a comment that explains.
  (I would like to know)

- 2nd kmalloc_track_caller is called which is more appropriate here by
  a small margin, No?
