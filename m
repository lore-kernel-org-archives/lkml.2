That's a good idea. The osd_login is a script supplied by us. And should
be submitted to nfs-utils by Steve. See the 4th patch sent as part of the
login patchset. I will change it to fork and timeout properly.

Regardless, for the long run I would like to pursue the Kernel-side timeout
as well, since that would be the more robust thing to do. Also in the light
that we provide root with the means to register a new osd_login program.
