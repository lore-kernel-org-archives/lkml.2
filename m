Err sorry, I thought you where feeding these types of kbuild/kconfig
changes into mainline via your own tree.  In that case, here is the
patch committed into the LIO upstream tree and
scsi-post-merge-2.6.git/for-linus branch.

Thanks!

Subject: [PATCH] gfs2: Remove 'select SYSFS ...' from Kconfig

With CONFIGFS_FS now doing 'select SYSFS' by default, the extra
'select SYSFS if GFS2_FS_LOCKING_DLM' for GFS2_FS is now unnecessary.
