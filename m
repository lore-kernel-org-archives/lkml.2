I agree hence my comment in the 4th patch:
	"In the blasphemous occasions that a the Kernel must call a user-mode program"

I have added a new caller, to the nfs/objectlayoutdriver.ko that uses this
facility for auto-login into osd-targets (iscsi-targets) when new are requested
by the filesystem. This auto-login facility is mandated by the pnfs-objects
standard because in a large cluster filesystems for which pnfs was invented, storage
devices break and changed everyday, and a manual login by every client is not
feasible.

You can see this patch as posted to the mailing list here:
	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.nfs/48024/match=login
	[title: pnfs-obj: autologin: Add support for protocol autologin]

It works very well and was heavily tested, with all error scenarios, but
the theoretical possibility that the user-mode program can be stuck forever
bothers me and I would like to do something about it. With this patch the
Kernel can recover cleanly and continue. I have actually tested this part
and it works as expected.

Thanks
Boaz
