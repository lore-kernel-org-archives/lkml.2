Christoph asked me to leave it out to avoid the push-down + remove=20
noise.  I missed it in v1, added it in v2, then took it out again. =20
Ultimately that isn't the real problem, though:

Ah, yeah, that makes sense.  I missed the shrink_dcache_parent side=20
effect.  I suspect we just need something like the below?  (Very lightly=20
tested!)

Thanks-

Subject: [PATCH 1/3] vfs: shrink_dcache_parent before rmdir, dir rename

The dentry_unhash push-down series missed that shink_dcache_parent needs to
be called prior to rmdir or dir rename to clear DCACHE_REFERENCED and
allow efficient dentry reclaim.
