Why?

Because some process may get the EACCES error half way through it's 
operation.

Ok, that needs documenting.

So far we seem to have established that the old way of doing things was 
bad because it produced non-posix behaviour and could lead to data 
corruption if a ticket expires while a process needs it.

And the new way is bad because it leaves people puzzling over hung 
workstations in the morning.

The traditional Kerberos/AFS way was to behave the old way, and use 
krenew to keep the ticket from expiring if a process needed to be run 
overnight.

What other way is there of fixing the problem if we are going to keep 
the "hang 'till a ticket turns up" behaviour?  (rewrite gnome and kde 
seems kind of a big job).
