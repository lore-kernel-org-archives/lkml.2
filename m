David,

The dentry -> inode relationship is a N:1 relationship. Therefore, it is
hard to believe that your example below would still work if we were 
trying to fill the cache through link operations, instead of operations 
like mkdir, that enforce a 1:1 relationship.

Caping the dentry numbers, OTOH, caps the # of inodes as well. Although 
we *do* can have inodes lying around in the caches without an associated 
dentry at some point in time, we cannot have inodes *pinned* into the 
cache without an associated dentry. So they will soon enough go away.

So maybe it is the other way around here, and it is people that wants an 
inode capping that should model it after a dentry cache capping.

As said above, mkdir enforces a 1:1 relationship (because directories 
can't be hard linked) that can't be guaranteed in the general case. For 
the general case, one can have a dentry cache bigger than Linus' ego 
while instantiating only one inode in the process.

Well, if this is the problem, I am happy returning EDQUOT if we fail to 
find room for more dentries, or anything else we can agree upon instead 
of ENOMEM.

well, I myself am done for now with the per-subtree proposal. I am

This is apples to oranges comparison. If instead of using the mechanism 
I proposed, we go for a quota-based mechanism like you mentioned, we'll 
fail just as often. Just with EDQUOT instead of ENOMEM.

Humm.. while writing that I just looked back on the code, and it seems 
it will be hard to return anything but ENOMEM, since it is part of the 
interface contract. OTOH, the inode allocation function goes for the 
same kind of contract - returning NULL in case of error - meaning that 
everything of this kind that does not involve the filesystem will end up 
the same way. Be it in the icache, or dcache.

I don't see how/why a user application should care. An error means "Hey 
Mr. Userspace, something wrong happened", not "Hey Mr. Userspace, sorry, 
we tried really hard, but yet could not do it".

As far as a container is concerned, The only way to mimic the behavior 
you described would be to allow a single container to use up at most X 
bytes of general kernel memory. So when the dcache reaches the wall, it 
can borrow from somewhere else. Not that I am considering this...

Again, I don't think those hard limits are about used memory. So if 
freeing a dentry may not free memory, I'm still fine with that. If the 
kernel as a whole needs memory later, it can do something to reclaim it.
*Unless* I hold a dentry reference. So the solution to me seems to be 
not allowing more than X to be held in the first place.

Again: I couldn't care less about how much *memory* it is actually using 
at a certain point in time.

What you described does not seem to me as a corner case.
"By using this option you can't use more than X entries, if you do, 
you'll fail" sounds pretty precise to me.

Again, I understand you, but I don't think we're really solving the same 
thing.
