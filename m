I think this is problematic.  It looks exactly like other existing
DEFINE macros yet what its semantics is different.  I don't think
that's a good idea.

I think that it would be best to keep this one simple & obvious, which
already has enough in-kernel users to justify its existence.  There
are significant benefits in being trivially understandable and
expectable.  If we want more advanced ones - say resizing, hybrid or
what not, let's make that a separate one.  No need to complicate the
common straight-forward case for that.

So, I think it would be best to keep this one as straight-forward and
trivial as possible.  Helper macros to help its users are fine but
let's please not go for full encapsulation.

Thanks.
