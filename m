Hi Google and maintainers,

I have a kernel booting problem with kernels above 2.6.37 on Debian
Squeeze, on HP G6 hardware, which have the harddisk controller:

 HP Smart Array P410i Controller / Smart Array G6 controllers

This problem is (of cause) related to the introduction of the driver
HPSA, which takes over from the driver CCISS (the overlapping PCI IDs
were removed in commit 6fa977520871 see below).

This driver transition causes the device names to change
  from /dev/cciss/c0d0p1
  to   /dev/sda1.

Thus, it would be really nice if UUID / LABEL / udev worked, as it
would make it possible to boot kernels above and below 2.6.37.

== Here comes the BUG and work-around ==

The BUG is that, if I compile the kernel and include the CCISS driver
(even-though it will not be used), then initramfs will drop me into a
shell, complaining that it cannot find /dev/disk/by-uuid/...

The work-around is, either
 1) to avoid using initrd images, or
 2) don't compile the kernel with the CCISS driver.

== Maintainers tasks ==

I suspect the bug lies in initramfs-tools, or the udev version used by
initramfs-tools.

Could the maintainers of initramfs-tools and udev, please tell me
something like its fixed in version XXX, and the Debian maintainers
just need to compile initramfs-tools with this version to fix the
issue? ;-)

 initramfs-tools Version: 0.98.8
 udev            Version: 164-3

ps. I'm testing with net-next 2.6.38-rc5-02558-g07df529

    cciss: remove overlapping PCI IDs
    
    This patch removes the controller overlap between cciss and hpsa. It was
    decided that no overlap should exist. All new controllers will use the hpsa
    SCSI based driver.
