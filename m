I would want to know if data was lost.

Intuition means nothing if I get an error.

If it were possible I'd like:

1. write works
1a. WRITE RPC fails, data stays in cache
2. ticket renewed
3. fsync works, data written

But:

1. write...
1a. WRITE RPC fails
1b. ... fails

seems ok.

Even

1. write works
1a WRITE RPC fails
2. ticket renewed
3. fsync fails

would be ok for me.  (light cone problems?)
