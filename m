The only way to switch owner is for the current owner to release and a
new owner to acquire the lock. Also we already bail the spin loop when
owner changes.

Loop exit latency mostly, the lighter the loop, the faster you're
through the less time you waste once the condition is true, but yeah,
what you say is true too, its a balance game as always.

The thing I used for the initial implementation is mentioned in the
changelog (0d66bf6d3):

    Testing with Ingo's test-mutex application (http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/8/50)
    gave a 345% boost for VFS scalability on my testbox:
    
     # ./test-mutex-shm V 16 10 | grep "^avg ops"
     avg ops/sec:               296604
    
     # ./test-mutex-shm V 16 10 | grep "^avg ops"
     avg ops/sec:               85870

I've no idea how heavy that is on trylock though, you'd have to look at
that.

Chris did some improvements using dbench in ac6e60ee4 but clearly that
isn't working for you.
