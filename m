Yes, I think this makes alot of sense as the next step beyond what has
been currently proposed so far with these series for .37.  The main bit
with this approach is that is requires touching every single legacy
LLD's ->queuecommand() which honestly is a bit scary on some of the
legacy stuff.  This instead of the approach this series has taken so far
to simply to still be able to use the LLDs we are unsure about running
in host_lock less mode in mainline+ out of tree (who do not muck with
host_lock in ->queuecommand of course :) will still 'just work'.

Its hard to say how to say which approach is better at this point, but I
am still leaning toward IMHO the unlocked_qcmds=1 would be the safest
incremental first step for .37, and then do the second series for .38 to
get any LLD needing host_lock using it directly inside of their
->queuecommand().

This sounds like a pretty reasonable compromise that I think is slightly
less risky for the LLDs with the ghosts and cob-webs hanging off of
them.

What do you think..?
