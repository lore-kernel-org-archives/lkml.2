Sorry, about only affects virtio, I'm not very clear here:
1) Just duplicate the disk name format function in virtio_blk
     like the original patch: https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/28/45
2) Move the disk name format function into block core like
     this patch series but only affects virtio(not affect mtip32xx).
Do you mean the 2) one or something else?

Sure.
