Not really.  What I meant here is that this series needs to be applied
after the original 14 part series 'for .39 scsi-misc' fixes held over
for .38..

I was not sure if scsi-misc was for fixes only now, and if new target
code (like this series) should be going into scsi-post-merge or what..
So it sounds like this series for configfs statistics infrastructure and
initial TCM_Loop merge should be going through scsi-misc as well for
mainline .39, yes..?

Also, just another heads up in TCM fabric module land.  At this point in
lio-core-2.6.git/lio-4.1, drivers/target/iscsi/ has been fully converted
to use mainline libiscsi -> include/scsi/iscsi_proto.h definitions with
a few small additions/corrections.  This also includes a new set of
iSCSI fabric dependent ConfigFS statistics groups, and include the
removal of legacy ProcFS code from iscsi_target_mod.

The full iscsi_target_mod series will be posted in the next days for
review and comments.
