Thanks for including us in the cc, Matt.  
We don't need the system call for DMTCP either.

Also, in our DMTCP user base, we haven't had any requests to support
checkpointing of user code with get_robust_list().  If a user had needed
this or a similar system call, I suspect our new plugin architecture
would make it easy to eupport.  But it's a non-issue now.

Thanks,
- Gene
