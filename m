I think the 'fragile as hell' and 'complicated to set up' ring the most
true here.  Thank you Linus..

This is an incorrect statement.  I was very specific in May what type of
authentication passthrough that I want for iscsi-target, and why moving
the entire login path to userspace is a really bad idea for a
kernel-level iscsi-target that has a configfs control plane supporting
fully dynamic configuration.  So while I very much apprectiate the
efforts by Tomo directed by yourself, this is *not* what I asked for,
and is not acceptable for LIO iscsi-target code for the default login
codepath.

So restate what I want:  A passthrough for pushing 'optional to
implement' iSCSI authentication payloads to userspace (like we had in
LIO v2.x) that can be enabled optionally on a per iSCSI target endpoint
context, and does not touch the default login path.  The specific code
reasons for this have not changed at all in the last months, and can be
found here for reference:

I completely disagree.

Again, the 'optional to implement' authentication methods are what needs
to goto userspace in seperate authentication specific daemons, and not
the entire login control path into a single userspace process for even
the 'authentication disabled' case.  This is the wrong split.

Also, the patch did not address any form of backwards compatability
because it did not provide any patches for rtslib to expose the new
functionality to application level devels and distros who are already
integrating this package.

As mentioned before, we (LIO and RTS) have no interest in breaking a
python object library that already exposes iscsi-target functionality
users actually want, for a last-minute split that makes the overall
design less effective for the default cases the vast majority of people
actually care about.

And, we have also seen historically how painful the split has been with
open-iscsi, which in the end took much longer to get stable (and is
still harder to debug) than if a proper login split was used to begin
with.

I have been very willing to compromise on many things throughout this
target mode endevour, but making it more difficult for iscsi-target to
'just work' is not what the userbase wants, and will not be changing
this for the default two cases.
