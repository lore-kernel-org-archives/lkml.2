If there is already some flaw in program, the knowledge of an exit event
(it's not the only such event, just a sample) might make things worse.

The code is plain - register and wait for ssd exit.  Pass Length = chars
- CONST.  That's all.

If I use procfs, I have to poll /proc/PID/io.  I have to (1) catch the
right moment for the measurement and (2) identify whether I've actually
succeeded in the measurement time (that I've measured that I want to
measure).  With taskstats (1) and (2) are solved by definition.  But
it seems to me I'm starting to make circles :\


My sceptic position about the whole taskstats/procfs ability to gather
aliens' processes information:

"The core problem here is that by giving *some part* of information about
internal task activity the kernel violating the task privacy, strictly
speaking.  A program doing IO expects this activity to be kept private.
This revealed part may or may not reveal sensible information, depends
on the specific program."
