Hi Nick,

I promised you and James to get back to a throughout review for more
than just the backends.  It's still in progress, but here is what I
think is most important:

 - Sort of the the namepspace for both the file names and function
   names.  I think you reluctantly agreed to do that a while ago anyway,
   but I think it's time to bite the bullet now.  Please agree on a
   common prefix for both function names and modules.  I think the
   target name in the directory structure is the best one, but I really
   don't care too much.  The transport_ prefix used in some code is
   really misleading, and the se_ in other isn't too helpful either.
 - make sure backends, frontends and core/ code under drivers/target/
   are properly separated
 - clean up the exported - both as in EXPORT_SYMBOL and simply global
   functions.  There's a lot of things that should be static or not
   exported to modules but is right now.  The scripts/namespace.pl
   script in the kernel tree is a great helper for that.
 - Similarly the headers could use some re-arrangement.  I've been
   trying to make sense of what each header does but couldn't find it.
   In the optimal world you'd have one header for the front-end API,
   one of the back-end API and one or more for common structures
   and defintions.  All with a comment explaining what they are there
   for.
