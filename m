Actually it has nothing to do with 32 vs 64 bits as I
initially thought.  It happens on 64bits too, but takes
more time (or data to transfer) to trigger.

I bisected this issue to the following commit:

commit f03d78db65085609938fdb686238867e65003181
Author: Eric Dumazet <eric.dumazet@gmail.com>

    net: refine {udp|tcp|sctp}_mem limits

    Current tcp/udp/sctp global memory limits are not taking into account
    hugepages allocations, and allow 50% of ram to be used by buffers of a
    single protocol [ not counting space used by sockets / inodes ...]

    Lets use nr_free_buffer_pages() and allow a default of 1/8 of kernel ram
    per protocol, and a minimum of 128 pages.
    Heavy duty machines sysadmins probably need to tweak limits anyway.


Reverting this commit on top of 3.0 (or any later 3.x kernel) fixes
the behavour here.

This machine has 4Gb of memory.  On 3.0, with this patch applied
(as it is part of 3.0), tcp_mem is like this:

  21228     28306   42456

with this patch reverted, tcp_mem shows:

  81216     108288  162432

and with these values, it works fine.

So it looks like something else goes wrong there,
which lead to all nfsds fighting with each other
for something and eating 100% of available CPU
instead of servicing clients.

For added fun, when setting tcp_mem to the "good" value
from "bad" value (after booting into kernel with that
patch applied), the problem is _not_ fixed.

Any further hints?

Thanks,

/mjt
