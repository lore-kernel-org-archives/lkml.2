I am asking that ANY kobject release function call kfree to release the
memory that object is embedded in.  That is how kobjects work, please
read the documentation for more details.

True.

That's not "error prone", it's "people don't read the provided
documentation about how to use the API".

And yes, one could argue to make the API easier to use, and patches are
always welcome to do so.

There are good reasons, but the most important one being, if you pass
off an object, as of that moment in time, you had better handle the
reference counting correctly.  If you think of it this way, cleanup
logic is even simpler as that's the only rule you ever need to think
about, none of thies "half-initialized" stuff.

Again, yes.  Please read the documentation.

thanks,
