I've run it only once after creating all snapshots. My expectation is that
in both cases the result is the same. If all snapshots have the file /foo/bar,
then each individual snapshotted copy of it would have a different atime
and thus an own metadata block for it. As this happens with all files, no
matter how i iterated the files, then nearly all metadata blocks get their
own copy.
