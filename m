I mentioned how the new searching ioctl could be used to very quickly
find updated files, and that I was planning on adding this.  There were
a few questions about how it might work, so I worked up a prototype.

I had to make some small mods to the kernel side to be more friendly to
userland, mostly just fixing up how we advance through the keys.  For an
example of how this works, cloned the linux-26 git repo onto a fresh FS,
then modified a single file.

I timed how long it took find to find my one modified file (via find
-newer) and I timed my ioctl.

Find took 9s, the ioctl took .024s.

A repeat of the test on a much larger filesystem had find timed in at
25s and the ioctl at 2s.

The prototype is called btrfs subvol find-new and it can be found in the
master branch of the btrfs-progs-unstable repo.  I've updated the master branch
on the kernel side.  Here are the updates since my last pull request:
