Just to clear up what I said before, it seems that on plain 3.1-rc8, I am
actually able to clear the endless CPU use in nfs_writepages by just
running "sync". I am not sure when this changed, but I'm pretty sure that
some versions between 2.6.34 and 3.1-rc used to not be affected by just
"sync" unless it was paired with drop_caches. Maybe this makes the
problem more obvious...
