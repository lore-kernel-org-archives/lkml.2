Do you seriously think that this sysfs attribute can be removed someday
in the future if we get structured logging implemented?  It can't,
sorry, people will start depending on this and their jury-rigged
implementations will require it no matter what we do otherwise.

But that's still not the main issue here.

The main issue that I see is that this really doesn't solve the problem
that is trying to be addressed, and the authors admit that.  So for that
very reason alone I feel it should be rejected, but again, it's not my
subsystem to maintain or control.

best of luck,
