Yes, the passing down is just a userland program that gets SCSI
commands from the guest, sends them via SG_IO, and passes back the
result.  If the userland program is unprivileged (it usually is), then
you go through the filter.

This is the userland for virtio-scsi (the kernel part of virtio-scsi is just
a driver running in the guest).  It can run in two mode: it can do its own
SCSI emulation, or it can just relay CDBs and their results.

It can (and does) use higher-level services if SCSI emulation is done in
userland.  In that case, trim/discard can become a BLKDISCARD or a fallocate
for example.  However, in this case userland doesn't do any emulation and in
fact doesn't even need to know that this CDB is a discard.

Also, if it fails, there's no way to reconstruct the NAS's sense data to
pass it back to the guest.  We do a limited amount of "making up" sense
data (for example if a command is filtered, all we get is an errno value;
and we say it was not recognized), but it should really be as simple
and limited as possible.

Why not? :)  (BTW it was suggested by Alan Cox, that's just my proposal for
how to do it).  I think that it's a good idea, but it's a big bazooka for
the smaller issue of supporting trim/discard.

One example of block layer interfaces that I want to add is BLKPING, so
that you can see if the NAS is reachable.  Then SCSI emulation can map
the "test unit ready" command to BLKPING.  There's a handful of such
ioctls that would be useful, such as BLKDISCARD itself.

But this is for the other direction, where ioctls are not enough accurate.
