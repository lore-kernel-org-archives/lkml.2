Not, I think, a deadly sin for a SCSI maintainer.

A layering violation is a signal of bad design wherever it occurs, so
that wasn't a SCSI centric argument.

Since I didn't actually say any of that, I suggest you re-read text you
quoted above.  The phrase "The command transformation belongs in the ULD
so that's where the allocation and deallocation should be" might be a
relevant one to concentrate on.

This is a straw man:  You've tried to portray a position I've never
taken as mine then attack it ... with what is effectively another bogus
argument.

It's not an either/or choice.  I've asked the relevant parties to
combine the approaches and see if a REQ_TYPE_FS path that does the
allocations in the appropriate place, likely the ULD, produces a good
design.

Thanks for explaining that you have nothing to contribute, I'll make
sure you're not on my list of relevant parties.
