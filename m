Yes, the terminate marker in the destination list is set when initialization.
sg_set_page would not break this marker because it saved both the two
maker bits at sg_asign_page.

Also, the allocation of destination sg list considered the total number of
the source sg_list. So, sg_set_page can work correctly.

The value assignment method also can also work correctly, because the
termination marker in source sg_list has been set in blk_rq_map_sg(), as
the last entry of source sg_list is just copied to the the last entry
in destination
list.

Uh, Paolo, Boaz, have  you reached agreement on which method to use?
