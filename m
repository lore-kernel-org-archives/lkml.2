This doesn't impact the argument that we need to use the same path for
common and special auth cases.  We're not putting all the exotic RFC
auth cases in the kernel, so the common path needs to be out as well.

This seems a bit orthogonal to the argument.  Whether the driver uses
userspace upcalls or not, the scripts still have access.

That's fine ... I can easily give you another release cycle to do this.
