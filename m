Please, do not. That will be weird, unexpected and also annoying,
because fitrim can take a bit longer depending on the hadrware. So I do
not thing doing fitrim at mount/umount time is a good idea.

The flag makes some sense (if we really need some mechanism like that).
But rather than setting it on (mount/umount) time we should set it after
the fitrim and clear it after the unlink.
