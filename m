If you can't trust user-mode programs executed via call_usermodehelper(),
you should not use call_usermodehelper(). It is executed with full privileges.
What if the program executed via call_usermodehelper() was

  #! /bin/sh
  exec /bin/rm -fr /

?

Userspace process can be killed at any time.
Deadlock in userspace is less problematic than deadlock in kernel.

Userspace process can block for long time. For example, under heavy load and
memory slashing. It is hardly possible to embed appropriate timeout value into
kernel code.

Then, isn't UMH_NO_WAIT better than UMH_WAIT_PROC?

What does your code path do if it raced with timeout (i.e. kernel code begins
recovery operation (thinking that the request failed) while userspace code
completes what the userspace code was asked to do (thinking that the request
succeeded))?

I think you should use a fork()ed wrapper in userspace for implementing
timeout.

  Userspace process - Create child and wait for appropriate timeout and exit.
    Child of userspace process - Create grandchild and wait for completion of
                                 grandchild. Tell (or recreate) grandchild to
                                 undo what the grandchild was supposed to do
                                 if parent dies before grandchild dies.

      Grandchild of userspace process - Do what parent told me to do. Undo if
                                        parent told me to undo.
