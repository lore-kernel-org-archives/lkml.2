I have not tested FireWire CD-ROMs or card reader yet.

But today I did get the following crash on 3.0-rc6-71-g4dd1b49 x86-64 plus
Alan's "USB: additional regression fix for device removal" when I powered
down an USB hub with an empty USB card reader attached (or when I powered
it up, impossible for me to say):

general protection fault: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP DEBUG_PAGEALLOC

After this trace, the following messages were logged:
generic-usb 0003:046D:C51.0059: can't reset device, 0000:00:12.2-3.1.3/input/0, status -71

I can upload a screenshot of this crash if desired.

The 2.6.39 and 3.0 block and/or SCSI layer are in a really sad state.
