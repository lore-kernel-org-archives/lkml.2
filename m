If you are not able to deal with all patches received, the simple way
seems that you should share your burden with those maintainers who
like.

This seems one of the cool reasons that some subsystem, say in stable
stock kernel, is buggy, and end users have to face panic.

Newcomers, I think, are the cool gifts sent by Jesus and Buddha to
what is called GUN Linux, and the accepted patches do not remove the
buggy in the unaccepted patches, if the buggy does exist.

The first action on the received patch to what is under my maintenance
is to check whether there is really buggy. If yes, I apologize to the
patcher as soon as possible. Second the correctness of the solution,
if provided in patch, is checked as tough as I can, simply because
that no case of reproduction can not tell me it is not buggy. Third it
is my duty to be responsible for the stability of the subsystem in
what is called stable stock kernel, with little to do with the safety
of any patch, and I would share my ideas with the original patcher.

How stable is it? Would you like to show which version of ext4 is free of buggy?

Is happy meaning ext4 is free of buggy?

It seems the day to day duty to review patches for any maintainer, but
I am not sure.

I do not think his/her testing can ensure the safety of the patch, but
review is necessary.

End users do get privilege for free from GNU, other than to be treated
as rats and monkeys for any reason, I think.

If you like to provide free ext4 as stable, first above all, you
should be sure it is free of buggy, or at least you have to info end
users, as much as you can, how buggy it is.

In other words, if you like to provide free bread, and claim the bread
is safe, you must ensure the bread is free of poison, or you have to
info, as much as you can, those who take your bread that the bread is
not  free of poison, how danger the bread is.

Is it murder with no info at all?

Those right customers seems pay too much for what is unnecessary, and
IBM is lucky enough, unlike Toyota. Indeed I first hear that, a cool
story:)  I would share it with my friends. Thanks.

So these end users who aren't paying do get treated as rats and monkeys by you?

No, no and no, in any way, end users are not pigs in Guinea but users
of GNU Linux, I believe. Jesus and Buddha, please, rescue me.

So it is clear ext4 is not free of buggy but in stable linux-2.6.32.

And you achieved a lot, but I think ext4 is another ext3.

Nobody want to die, it is a life not so hard.

GNU is free, Linux is also free, it sounds cool, for any user at least today.

Nice words. And How about those users in Guinea?

My buggy is still not in the stable kernel, right?

My mind is changed, I should not be a maintainer like you who are
treating users differently.

My answer is simple, I would apologize to all patchers first.
