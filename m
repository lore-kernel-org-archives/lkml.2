This is a very good question. During implementation I spent a lot of
time working on it.

In fact, the first implementation was asynchronous similarly as you
proposing, i.e. it just proceed with what you were doing and let it die
its own peaceful death some time later. But soon the implementation was
becoming so complicated, so it started getting out of control. For
instance, some of the tasks to solve with this approach were:

1. What to do if another SCST object is being created with the same name
as supposed to be deleted, but not completely dead yet?

2. What to do if a dieing object is found on some list and reference for
is supposed to be taken? If the object deleted from the list before it
marked dieing, i.e. the latest internal put() done, it made additional
problems during deleting it after the latest external put done.

...

So, I decided to reimplement it to be completely synchronous. SYSFS
authors did really great job and thanks to the excellent internal SYSFS
design and implementation it is absolutely safe. See:

Everything works fine.

This is because SYSFS doesn't hold references for the corresponding
kobjects for every open file handle. It holds references only when
show() and store() functions called. So, everything is under control and
a malicious user can do nothing to hold a reference forever.
