And nfs_detach_delegation_locked() rechecks nfsi->delegation() under
the lock, so this is a legitimate use.

The pointer is not held constant, but any changes will be accounted
for and handled correctly.  So I would argue that the pointer value is
in fact protected by the recheck-under-lock algorithm used here.
