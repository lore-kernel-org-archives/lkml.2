Actually, with a /proc/self/sigqueue file as Eric suggested, , it
would be possible to mitigate some races even if you're not passed a
fd from the target or its parent. Consider:

1) Read somedaemon.pid
2) Open the /proc/$pid directory
3) Use openat to open /proc/$pid/status; check that Name: matches the
daemon's name; if not go to 1
4) Use openat to open /proc/$pid/sigqueue; send a signal

It's not foolproof, in that you might hit a different process with the
same name+uid+gid+groups+cmdline+environment+etc, but any such
cross-process operation is racy to the extent that, at some level, you
need to have criteria for selecting your target, and such criteria
might allow for false positives.
