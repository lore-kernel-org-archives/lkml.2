The culprit seems to be do_wp_page -> file_update_time ->
mark_inode_dirty_sync.  This surprises me for two reasons:

 - Why the _sync?  Are we worried that data will be written out before
the metadata?  If so, surely there's a better way than adding latency
here.

 - Why are we calling file_update_time at all?  Presumably we also
update the time when the page is written back (if not, that sounds
like a bug, since the contents may be changed after something saw the
mtime update), and, if so, why bother updating it on the first write?
Anything that relies on this behavior is, I think, unreliable, because
the page could be made writable arbitrarily early by another program
that changes nothing.
