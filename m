I couldn't get above to apply on a 2.6.35.10 kernel, but applied to
a 2.6.37 the problem seems solved. Have they been queued up for stable?

This one alone applied to 2.6.35 didn't solve it.

jk@clyde:~$ time sync

real    19m2.650s
user    0m0.000s
sys    0m0.030s

Without notable disk-activity while waiting. (<5MB/s measured using dstat)
This sample was "decent" I've seen sync times over 2 horus on this system
with 128GB of memory.. again without any notable disk-activity while 
waiting.

Thanks for your prompt response.
