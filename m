Hello,

Maybe HIGHPRI but definitely not CPU_INTENSIVE, but even HIGHPRI isn't
usually necessary.  The queue of pending works tend to be short and
consumed pretty fast.

There are no separate workqueues.  There's one per cpu which is used
by all workqueue users.  HIGHPRI boosts the queueing order in that
queue.

CPU_INTENSIVE isn't applicable at all unless you want to run crypto or
zlib from the driver.

blk_iopoll runs off softirq and will always have lower latency than
workqueue which requires scheduling, so it depends on the
requirements.  I guess the best thing would be playing with things a
bit and make decisions on test results.  It shouldn't be too difficult
to switch among them.

Thanks.
