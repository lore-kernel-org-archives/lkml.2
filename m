There were made as simple as possible - i.e. notifier holds a client 
while creating of destroying PipeFS dentries. But event in this case 
there were races.

BTW, I'm really confused with these re-incrementing reference counter 
technic. It makes life-time of RPC client unpredictable.
Is this a real-world valid situation, when usage of it reached zero, but 
while we destroying auth, there can some other user of client appear and 
client become alive again?
It it was done just to make sure that client is still active while we 
destroying auth, then maybe we can just remove the client from the 
clients list before rpc_free_auth? It will simplify the notifier 
callback logic greatly...

This is probably not a bug (I can't llok at the code right now; because 
these dentries will be destroyed), but a flaw.
Today (without this patch) notifier can try to create dentries for 
clients, which are dead already (i.e. auth was destroyed and client is 
going to be destroyed very soon, but notifier gained lock first.
