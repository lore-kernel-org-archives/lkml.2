kerrrrapp!!  There's always value in replacing open-coded straggles
with calls to well-understood, well-documented, well-tested library
code.

Hello?  This is Linux.  We're continuously filtering through old code,
improving and updating it.  There's nothing which exempts
./drivers/scsi/ from our reasons for doing this.

copy_from_user() can take a fault, take a zillion locks, perform
GFP_HIGHUSER allocations, enter page reclaim, enter filesystems, etc. 
View a pagefault as a syscall with a different calling convention -
it's that high level.

If this driver if correct in potentially taking a pagefault at this
place then the patch is correct and desirable.  Otherwise, well, the
driver already has problem and the patch did nothing to increase them.

And, of course, Julia's "no value" work caused us to identify those
problems.
