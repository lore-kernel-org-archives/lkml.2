I agreed that you needed to do something about it, not that this is the
correct way to do it.

Think for a second as to why your code path looks different from EVERY
other kobject user in the kernel.  Perhaps it is incorrect?  You don't
need all this completion mess, in fact, it's wrong.

Just do what everyone else does please, as that is the simpler, and
correct, way to do it.

Oh, and why are you using a kobject at all anyway?  Shouldn't you be
using a 'struct device'?

Anyway, I don't have time for this anymore for the next 2 weeks, good
luck.
