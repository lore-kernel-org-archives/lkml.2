Subject: [PATCH -mmotm 00/30] [RFC] swap over nfs -v21
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,

Here's the latest version of swap over NFS series since -v20 last October. We decide to push
this feature as it is useful for NAS or virt environment.

The patches are against the mmotm-2010-07-01. We can split the patchset into following parts:

Patch 1 - 12: provides a generic reserve framework. This framework
could also be used to get rid of some of the __GFP_NOFAIL users.

Patch 13 - 15: Provide some generic network infrastructure needed later on.

Patch 16 - 21: reserve a little pool to act as a receive buffer, this allows us to
inspect packets before tossing them.

Patch 22 - 23: Generic vm infrastructure to handle swapping to a filesystem instead of a block
device.

Patch 24 - 27: convert NFS to make use of the new network and vm infrastructure to
provide swap over NFS.

Patch 28 - 30: minor bug fixing with latest -mmotm.

[some history]
v19: http://lwn.net/Articles/301915/
v20: http://lwn.net/Articles/355350/

Changes since v20:
	- rebased to mmotm-2010-07-01
	- dropped the null pointer deref patch for the root cause is wrong SWP_FILE enum
	- some minor build fixes
	- fix a null pointer deref with mmotm-2010-07-01
	- fix a bug when swap with multi files on the same nfs server
