James, the issue here is that currently shipping Windows hosts don't even do
what I am handling here. Based on the input I got from you and Christoph,
I convinced the windows team to at least return the SRB status that indicates
an illegal request. I will suggest to them that perhaps they should also set the
correct sense code and so I would not need this patch. However, keep in mind
that there is no current ETA on when Windows will ship with these changes - Windows 8
may ship with code where they would return an invalid SRB status, but they are not 
setting the sense code, hence this patch. When the Window host does the "right thing"
I will clean this up, but I don't know when that will be.

More importantly, the second patch  in this series where I filter out the ATA_16 command
on the guest is really important for us. Without that patch on a range on windows hosts
including the current beta version of windows8 where the host is returning a generic 
error in response to ATA_16 command, we cannot boot many Linux distros. If you
prefer, I can drop the first patch and re-submit the second patch for consideration now.

Regards,

K. Y
