Or you could just realize that unaligned accesses are slow in the best 
case, and are simply not supported on some processors.

If you think a little bit, I bet you could come up with a solution that 
operates at cacheline-aligned granularity, something that would be _even 
faster_ than simply fixing the code to do aligned accesses.
