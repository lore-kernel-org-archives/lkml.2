  I'm not sure they would be willing to try a different kernel because it's
a production system. But maybe I can find out what SG_IO command is sent
via strace?

  But then it seems like they really want to be able to forbid sending
SG_IO commands to some devices while allowing them for other devices and
the distinction by partition / non-partition is a bit arbitrary?

  I'm not sure whether you need to filter individual SG_IO commands or not.
For your use case it seems that being able to forbid SG_IO completely for
some fd (which would be passed to qemu) would be enough? But maybe filters
are simpler to implement because they already exist, I don't really know...
