If that is possible, I think it's so helpful. But most of driver
developers doesn't like that... They may tend to continue using
printk() debug/error notification. (actually I hope them to
use some notification API, like traceevent...)

Maybe, some kind of errors, like AER/MCE, easily move on to
such smarter system. But I doubt other device-specific errors
can do that too. There are so much specific kind of errors...

I agree with you that the _smart_ error notifier can solve our
problem too. However, we can't jump into it directly.
And just making printk() readable helps us A LOT!

Good point! we have to consider multipath case in document.
Perhaps, we need a special naming rule in that case. I think
it can be solved if udev script is enough smart :-)
