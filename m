Subject: [PATCH/RFC] user_ns: fix missing limiting of user_ns counts
Message-ID: <20121228175627.GA7683@cachalot>
MIME-Version: 1.0

Currently there is completely no limiting in number of user namespaces
created by unprivileged users.  One can freely create thousands of
user_ns'es and exhaust kernel memory without even bumping in
RLIMIT_NPROC or similar.

Even more -- it allows user to overflow kernel stack theoretically
allowing user to overwrite some important kernel data.  The problem is
that free_user_ns() may also free its parent user_namespace recursively
calling free_user_ns().  As kernel stack is very limited, it leads to
kernel stack overflow.

The code needs several checks.  First, noone should be able to create
user_ns of arbitrary depth.  Besides kernel stack overflow one could
create too big depth to DoS processes belonging to other users by
forcing them to loop a long time in cap_capable called from some
ns_capable() (e.g. in case one does smth like "ls -R /proc").  Second,
non-privileged users must not be able to overlimit some count of
namespaces to not be able to exhaust kernel memory.

The included patch is a basic fix for both or them.  Both values are
hardcoded here to 100 max depth and 1000 max in total.  I'm not sure how
better to make them configurable.  Looks like it needs some sysctl value
like kernel.max_user_ns_per_user, but also something more configurable
like new rlimit'ish limit may be created for user_ns needs.  E.g. in
case root wants one user to contain hundreds of private containers
(container owner user), but he doesn't want anybody to fill the kernel
with hundreds of containers multiplied by number of system users (equals
to thousands).

I'm not sure how it is an approved way for user_ns.  Eric?

A related issue which is NOT FIXED HERE is limits for all resources
available for containerized pseudo roots.  E.g. I succeeded creating
thousands of veth network devices without problems by a non-root user,
there seems no limit in number of network devices.  I suspect it is
possible to setup routing and net_ns'es the way it will be very
time-consuming for kernel to handle IP packets inside of ksoftirq, which
is not counted as this user scheduler time.   I suppose the issue is not
veth-specific, almost all newly available for unprivileged users code
pathes are vulnerable to DoS attacks.
