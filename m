Honestly, I didn't expect such a positive reaction from you in the first
reply :)

It is also used in cases where there is implicit or explicit limit on
some other resource per process leading to the global limit of
RLIMIT_NPROC*X.  The most obvious case of X is RLIMIT_AS.

Purely pragmatic approach is introducing the check in execve() to
heuristically limit the number of user processes.  If the program uses
PAM to register a user session, maxlogins from pam_limits is the Right
Way.  But many programs simply don't use PAM because of the performance
issues.  E.g. apache doesn't use PAM.  On a shared web hosting this is a
real issue.

In -ow patch execve() checked for the exceeded RLIMIT_NPROC, which
effectively solved Apache's problem.

...and execve() error handling is hard to miss ;-)

There are checks only in copy_process() and set_user().
