For the case that you are limited already, and then want to unlimit,
keeping the accounting, yes, it makes sense.

So far, yes, this is the only case that makes sense, and the fewer the
better. In any case it exists, and I wanted to be generic.

Well, this is semantics. I can change, but for me it makes a lot of
sense to think of it in terms of a percentage, because it is easy to
administer. You don't actually write a percentage, which I tried to
clarify by using the term "effective set as a percentage".
