Oh right, I didn't realize this. Thanks for pointing this out.

Yes, this is better.

Right...

So this also reminds me that as long as CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is selected,
the blk_pm_add/put/peek_request functions will be in the block IO path.
Shall we introduce a new config option to selectively build block
runtime PM functionality? something like CONFIG_BLK_PM_RUNTIME perhaps?

Just some condition checks in those functions, not sure if it is worth a
new config though. Please suggest, thanks.

Yes, they are needed. Thanks!
