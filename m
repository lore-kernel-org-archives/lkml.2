I'm stumped by this; maybe Ted can see if I'm missing something.

(and Nix, is there anything special about your fs?  Any nondefault
mkfs or mount options, external journal, inordinately large fs, or
anything like that?)

The suspect commit added this in jbd2_mark_journal_empty():

        /* Is it already empty? */
        if (sb->s_start == 0) {
                read_unlock(&journal->j_state_lock);
                return;
        }

thereby short circuiting the function.

But Ted's suggestion that mounting the fs, doing a little work, and
unmounting before we wrap would lead to this doesn't make sense to
me.  When I do a little work, s_start is at 1, not 0.  We start
the journal at s_first:

load_superblock()
	journal->j_first = be32_to_cpu(sb->s_first);

And when we wrap the journal, we wrap back to j_first:

jbd2_journal_next_log_block():
        if (journal->j_head == journal->j_last)
                journal->j_head = journal->j_first;

and j_first comes from s_first, which is set at journal creation
time to be "1" for an internal journal.

So s_start == 0 sure looks special to me; so far I can only see that
we get there if we've been through jbd2_mark_journal_empty() already,
though I'm eyeballing jbd2_journal_get_log_tail() as well.

Ted's proposed patch seems harmless but so far I don't understand
what problem it fixes, and I cannot recreate getting to
jbd2_mark_journal_empty() with a dirty log and s_start == 0.
