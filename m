Well, ~2x speedup on x86 is certainly a good achievement, but there
are more ARM based devices than there are PCs, and I guess many
embedded devices use lzo compressed kernels and file systems
while I'm not convinced many PCs rely on lzo in the kernel.

I know everyone's either busy or on vacation, but it would
be so cool if someone could test on a more modern ARM core,
with the userspace test code I posted it should be easy to do.
