I thought your problem is group idle issue. fsync uses WRITE_SYNC, which
will make the queue be sync-non-idle because REQ_NOIDLE is set. This is
exactly what Corrado's patch for. a fsync queue itself isn't idle unless
it's the last queue in a group. Am I missing anything?

That is possible, the think time check (even for queues) always has such
issue. Not sure how severe the issue is. Assume jbd will dispatch
several requests and this will make fsync thread think time big.

Hmm, CFQ only allows idling on sync queues, sync-no-idle queue isn't
allowed idling.
