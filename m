Well, it seems that the freezing of kernel threads in the first step
is not necessary.  You can do (1) freeze user space, (2) check if there's
enough free memory, (3) free memory if necessary, (4) freeze kernel
threads instead.  Which is what my patch does, actually. :-)

Yes, there is a known problem with FUSE in that area.
