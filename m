Thanks, updated patch is appended.

Apparently, I'm not good at writing changelogs late in the night.

Subject: PM / Runtime: Update documentation of interactions with system sleep

The documents describing the interactions between runtime PM and
system sleep generally refer to the model in which the system sleep
state is entered through a global firmware or hardware operation.
As a result, some recommendations given in there are not entirely
suitable for systems in which this is not the case.  Update the
documentation to take the existence of those systems into account.
