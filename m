Well, unsurprisingly, I was aware of the issue via Novell customer
interactions.  Since you've outed LSI, we can discuss it openly.

The fact is that for medium errors, every other array returns valid data
up to the erroring sector.

Plus all disk devices transfer up to the error sector.  Additionally,
Martin Petersen uses the same code for DIF and he's secured external
agreement from the DIF based arrays that nothwithstanding the ambiguity
in the SCSI standards, all DIF arrays return valid data up to the sector
with the DIF error.

OK, so I checked, and I think all of the major in-use HBA drivers today
do set the residue, so I'd be reasonably happy with a modification like
the following.  It basically believes the lower of either the
transferred data or the listed error (assuming the listed error is
valid ... if it's invalid, we still assume we can't trust anything).
This should mean that HBA drivers that set the residue work for all
arrays and those that don't work as they do today.
