Then move ORE _out_ of MISC_FILESYSTEMS. There is no reason why it needs
to be there as long as the things it depends on are there.

The solution I proposed didn't involve having the user select anything
other than NFSv4.1 and possibly ASYNC_XOR.

...and this is _my_ nightmare. I dont' _want_ these selects anywhere in
the NFS subsystem.
