Subject: [PATCH 1/2] fs: add SEEK_HOLE and SEEK_DATA flags
Date: Thu, 21 Apr 2011 15:42:33 -0400
Message-Id: <1303414954-3315-1-git-send-email-josef@redhat.com>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This just gets us ready to support the SEEK_HOLE and SEEK_DATA flags.  Turns out
using fiemap in things like cp cause more problems than it solves, so lets try
and give userspace an interface that doesn't suck.  So we have

-SEEK_HOLE: this moves the file pos to the nearest hole in the file from the
given position.  If the given position is a hole then pos won't move.  A "hole"
is defined by whatever the fs feels like defining it to be.  In simple things
like ext2/3 it will simplly mean an unallocated space in the file.  For more
complex things where you have preallocated space then that is left up to the
filesystem.  Since preallocated space is supposed to return all 0's it is
perfectly legitimate to have SEEK_HOLE dump you out at the start of a
preallocated extent, but then again if this is not something you can do and be
sure the extent isn't in the middle of being converted to a real extent then it
is also perfectly legitimate to skip preallocated extents and only park f_pos at
a truly unallocated section.

-SEEK_DATA: this is obviously a little more self-explanatory.  Again the only
ambiguity comes in with preallocated extents.  If you have an fs that can't
reliably tell that the preallocated extent is in the process of turning into a
real extent, it is correct for SEEK_DATA to park you at a preallocated extent.

Thanks,
