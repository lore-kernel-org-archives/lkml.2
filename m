For restart, you're thinking of the fs/lockd/svc.c:restart_grace()
that's called on aisngal in lockd()?

I wonder if there's any way to figure out if that's actually used by
anyone?  (E.g. by any distro init scripts).  It strikes me as possibly
impossible to use correctly.  Perhaps we could deprecate it....

If it's really the signalling that's the problem--perhaps we can get
away from the signal-based interface.

At least in the case of lockd I suspect we could.

Or perhaps the decision to share a single lockd thread (or set of nsfd
threads) among multiple network namespaces was a poor one.  But I
realize multithreading lockd doesn't look easy.
