So dm-crypt cpu scalability v5 with 2.6.36 worked fine.

Seems this emerge is a good test if it reliably enduces the corruption.

Have you actually experienced any of the issues the above patches are
meant to address?  Seems you're applying patches guessing/hoping
that they'll fix the dm-crypt corruption.

That md patch doesn't help DM at all.  And the ext4 coordination patch
is completely bleeding and actually broken (especially as it relates to
DM -- but that breakage is ony a concern for request-based DM,
e.g. DM-mapth), anyway see: 
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2010-November/msg00185.html

I'm not sure which patches you're using for the ext4 fsync changes but
please don't use them at all.  It is purely an optimization for
extremely heavy fsync workloads and is only getting in the way at this
point.

We need better fault isolation; you've introduced enough change that it
isn't helping zero in on what your particular problem is.  Milan has
tested he latest version of the dm-crypt cpu scalability patch quite a
bit and hasn't seen any corruption -- but clearly the corruption you're
seeing is a real concern and we need to get to the bottom of it.

I'd really appreciate it if you could just use Linus' latest linux-2.6
tree plus Milan's latest patch (technically v6 even though it wasn't
labeled as such): https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/365542/

Porting that same v6 patch to 2.6.36 would also be nice (to verify you
still don't see any corruption there).
