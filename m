Agreed. The current situation is a mess, which is why I suggested a
cleanup and overhaul before you do this...

The vs_hidden flag is intended to show that a particular program
version should not be registered with (or unregistered from) the
portmapper. Unfortunately, nothing looks at vs_hidden during
registration time, only when unregistering (as you mention).

It's quite possible that several svc_versions declared in the kernel do
not have this set correctly. One thing that would be good is to audit
each of those.

We currently rely on SVC_SOCK_ANONYMOUS for registration, but that
wasn't its original intent. It's was just convenient to use it there
too.

SVC_SOCK_ANONYMOUS was (as best I can tell) originally intended for use
on temporary sockets that we establish on receive. So for
instance...when a client connects to nfsd, we need to create a new
socket for nfsd, but obviously we don't want to register that socket
with the portmapper (since nfsd should already be registered there).
SVC_SOCK_ANONYMOUS ensures that that socket is not registered.

The whole scheme could probably use a fundamental re-think. I'm not
sure I have a great idea to propose in lieu of it, but I think adding
yet another flag here is probably not the best way to go.
