Then maybe you can use pm_runtime_no_callbacks() for the ZPODD device.  
It's explained in Documentation/power/runtime_pm.txt, and I use it for 
USB interfaces.

The idea is that the ZPODD will never receive any runtime PM callbacks 
from the PM core.  Instead the ATA port callback routines will be 
responsible for power management of the ZPODD device.
