What's wrong with ftruncate() for this?

There's plenty of open questions about the interface if we allow
hole punching to change the file size. e.g. where do we set the EOF
(offset or offset+len)?  What do we do with the rest of the blocks
that are now beyond EOF?  We weren't asked to punch them out, so do
we leave them behind? What if we are leaving written blocks beyond
EOF - does any filesystem other than XFS support that (i.e. are we
introducing different behaviour on different filesystems)?  And what
happens if the offset is beyond EOF? Do we extend the file, and if
so why wouldn't you just use ftruncate() instead?

IMO, allowing hole punching to change the file size makes it much
more complicated and hence less likely to simply do what the user
expects. It also is harder to implement and testing becomes much
more intricate. From that perspective, it does not seem desirable to
me...

Cheers,

Dave.
