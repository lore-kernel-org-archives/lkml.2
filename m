Actually, the original/historical purpose of the exec_id stuff was to
protect privileged parent processes (those having done a SUID/SGID exec)
from non-standard child exit signals, which could be set with clone().
I think we may want to audit the current implementation and see if it
still fully achieves the goal or maybe not (and fix it if not).

IIRC, 32 bits was considered enough because it was only the trusted
privileged parent process itself that could potentially cause a
wraparound.  (I did not verify this conclusion now.  It might be wrong.)

I include below pieces of the prototype implementation from
linux-2.2.12-ow6.tar.gz released in 1999.  One notable difference from
the code that went into mainline kernels was that I only incremented the
counter on privileged execve(), and I additionally handled counter
wraparound.  I am a bit concerned that a wraparound attack might be
possible on the code currently in mainline kernels, thereby allowing for
a bad exit signal to be sent to a privileged new parent program.  Does
anything prevent the wraparound attack currently?  (I did not check for
this yet, sorry.)

On exec:

+       bprm->priv_change = id_change || cap_raised;
+       if (bprm->priv_change) {
...
+               /*
+                * Increment the privileged execution counter, so that our
+                * old children know not to send bad exit_signal's to us.
+                * Also, wait on the lock if there's an exit_signal being
+                * sent to us now, to make sure it doesn't get sent to the

+               spin_lock_irqsave(&current->priv_lock, flags);

+                                       p->ppriv = 0;

+               spin_unlock_irqrestore(&current->priv_lock, flags);

In task_struct:

On fork() and clone():

Exit signal:

+       }

...

+       if (locked) spin_unlock_irqrestore(&tsk->p_pptr->priv_lock, flags);

IIRC, an equivalent of the above went upstream (with simplifications
and a variables rename by Alan) in 2.2.13, so that may be another
"reference implementation" to check against.
