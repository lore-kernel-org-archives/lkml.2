Phew. Here we go :). It looks to be more of a PPC specific problem than it appeared as at first:

    powerpc/iommu: Implement IOMMU pools to improve multiqueue adapter performance
    
    At the moment all queues in a multiqueue adapter will serialise
    against the IOMMU table lock. This is proving to be a big issue,
    especially with 10Gbit ethernet.
    
    This patch creates 4 pools and tries to spread the load across
    them. If the table is under 1GB in size we revert back to the
    original behaviour of 1 pool and 1 largealloc pool.
    
    We create a hash to map CPUs to pools. Since we prefer interrupts to
    be affinitised to primary CPUs, without some form of hashing we are
    very likely to end up using the same pool. As an example, POWER7
    has 4 way SMT and with 4 pools all primary threads will map to the
    same pool.
    
    The largealloc pool is reduced from 1/2 to 1/4 of the space to
    partially offset the overhead of breaking the table up into pools.
    
    Some performance numbers were obtained with a Chelsio T3 adapter on
    two POWER7 boxes, running a 100 session TCP round robin test.
    
    Performance improved 69% with this patch applied.
