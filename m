The design is actually very simple and not as powerful as you
probably desire.
I hate to get into the design of future features, when we haven't
even ACKed the current feature yet, but since you're the only one
did any review, I owe you that much ;-)

To exclude a file from snapshot it needs to have the NOCOW_FL flag.
Ironically, btrfs have already added that flag in parallel to me (for the
same purpose) so the flag it is already reserved in the code :-)

To avoid some transition issues and keep it really simple,
I disallow changing the NOCOW_FL
for regular file and only allow to change it for directories.
The NOCOW_FL is inherited from the parent directory,
so setting/clearing the flag on a directory means:
"All files/subdirs will be created excluded/not-excluded from now on".

Inside the snapshot image, excluded directories, which are not really
excluded, show normally, but excluded files are shown with zero length,
because making the files disappear is hard, but their blocks may have already
been reused, so we cannot allow access to them.

So there is actually no inherent "rollback" feature, not for a file/dir
and not for the entire fs.
It's a drawback of ext4 snapshots, but hey, cp/rsync from snapshot
still works for file/dir ;-)
As for full "fs" rollback. A revert tool has been developed (by students),
which requires an external storage to export the "revert patch".
This tool is going to be enhanced to use LVM snapshot storage
and LVM --merge option to implement ext4 "revert to snapshot" with Yum.

You think like a developer. Try talking to some sys admins.
Especially ones that worked with Solaris/ZFS or NetApp.
See what they think about snapshots and about the LVM alternative...
Snapshots have addictive qualities. Ones you've used them, you can't
go back to not having them.
Imagine how people used to live before the 'Undo' button and imagine
that your employer forced you to use an editor without an Undo button.
This is the kind of feedback I got from sys admins that moved from Solaris
to Linux.

Seriously, Lukas, talk to sys admins.
Letting the snapshot die silently is the worst possible thing that a snapshots
implementation can do (for long lived snapshots).

It's not hidden, it's accounted for as a regular file (usually owned by root).
You need a bit of scripting to gather the disk space used by snapshots (du).

In ANY snapshots implementation, you can get ENOSPC on operations,
which traditionally could not produce this error.
This statement is also true for thin provisioning implementations.
The question is how the implementation handles these situations.

What I came to realize on LSF, is that my implementation is the only
one (of LVM and btrfs) that tries to deal with the ENOSPC issue and
does a good job most of the time.

I deal with it by reserving space for metadata COW on snapshot
take, so if a future ENOSPC during metadata COW is possible,
snapshot take will fail with ENOSPC.

As for ENOSPC during regular file rewrite, that's not such a big problem.
The application simply gets ENOSPC as if the file was sparse to begin
with. It may not be pleasant if the application have fallocated the space
and used mmap/close without msync...
The only way I see around this issue is reserving space on mmap time
(and returning ENOSPC at that time), but again, this issue is shared
with btrfs, but is easier to fix (I think) with ext4 snapshots.
