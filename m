Hey, Vivek.

Or calculating the fraction of the hidden leaf node.

Any tasks should be treated as member of the hidden leaf node, so...

I don't know.  Wouldn't just explaining clearly in the comment e
enough?  I think the name "vfraction" is already weird enough to
indicate that it's something which you need to read explanation about.
If that explanation is readily available as comment, I think it should
be okay.

Yeah, no objection.  Let's beef up the explanation there.

I usually am not a big fan of adding wordy prefixes.  I think they
tend to obfuscate/frustrate more than help.  Let's stick a weird (that
is, non-generic) name to something weird and explain it well in the
comment.

Thanks.
