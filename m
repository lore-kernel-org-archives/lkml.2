That's the plan but I'm waiting for more of the briliant work that
recently popped up in XFS. For btrfs, the 3.2 introduced changes led
me to give here a try. I don't have nice pictures and digits in my
hand now but first tests shown close to 40% of timing improvements
between 2.6.39.4 and 3.2.7 - keep doing that great work guys (and
girls if any)!
