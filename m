What if it does? The rpc call will continue to execute until it
completes.

rpc_killall_tasks is really only useful for signalling to tasks that are
hanging on a completely unresponsive server that we want them to stop.
The only case where we really care is in rpc_shutdown_client(), where we
sleep and loop anyway.

All I care about is that it doesn't Oops.
