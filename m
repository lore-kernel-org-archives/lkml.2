Yes, but to clarify one item.   All of these patches in for-38-rc3 and
for-jejb branches have already been sent out to linux-scsi incrementally
when they where committed into LIO upstream code.  Are you asking that
the entire patch series be re-sent to linux-scsi against .38-rc2..?

Yes sorry, I should have been more specific here wrt to my
scsi-post-merge-2.6.git branches:

*) for-38-rc3: rebased to linus .38-rc2 tag

*) for-jejb: based on jejb scsi-post-merge-2.6.git/master @ .37-FINAL
from commit 7d2087a1820b (initial LIO target core v4.0.0-rc6 commit)

Both are now in sync with the upstream LIO tree v4.0.0-rc7 bugfixes, and
I have been keeping 'for-jejb' as convience for you against your initial
target merge.
