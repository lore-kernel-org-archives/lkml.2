Supposedly 2c7d46ec192e4f2b350f67a0e185b9bce646cd6b in Linus' tree
fixes thus bug, but I can trigger it reliably by asking for a check
of a RAID-1 volume.  ("echo check > /sys/block/md6/md/sync_action")

This particular volume is a 10-way (!) RAID-1, but I suspect smaller
numbers will work.

The same BUG is triggered on a RAID-10 thread for a volume that shares
the same physical drives.  Note that a check of *that* volume (md7)
does not trigger the problem.

2.6.35 does NOT exhibit this problem.

Here are two full kernel logs, boot to crash.  There are some local patches,
but they are quite unrelated.  (Mostly PPS device changes.)
