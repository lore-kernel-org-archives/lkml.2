I don't see this as a strict bypass because an successful attack would require:
- the ability to fork/clone _and_ call ptrace (which would otherwise
be blocked by the BPF if the user of the bpf cares)
- the ability to compromise a process with ptrace abilities for a
sandboxed process -- which means that a privilege escalation (in a
word) has already occurred.

However(!), if we did move secure_computing() to after ptrace _and_
added a check after SECCOMP_RET_TRACE's ptrace_event call, we could
ensure the system call was not changed by the tracer.  This would give
strong assurances that whatever system call is executed was explicitly
allowed by seccomp policy is the one that was executed.

I'm open to either leaving things alone (since it isn't horrible) or
making the change to tighten things up. Is the mode=1 behavior change
acceptable?  I assumed it wouldn't be, but perhaps I shouldn't have
made that assumption.

Regardless, I will go ahead and make patches and test them for both,
so they are on-hand regardless.

thanks!
