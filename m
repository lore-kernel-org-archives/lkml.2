Hmm, this is strange. How can you get down that road with the page lock
held? Is it possible this is related to the issue fixed by: 1d65f86d
(mm: preallocate page before lock_page() at filemap COW)?

As I said, I am not against this but I really want to see a valid use
case first. So far I haven't seen any because what you mention above is
a clear bug which should be fixed. I can imagine the huge number of
tasks in the group could be a problem as well but I would like to see
what are those problems first.

I guess that suicide-like oom in fact means "kill the poor soul that
happened to charge the last". I do not see any use case for this from
top of my head (appart from the performance benefits of course).
