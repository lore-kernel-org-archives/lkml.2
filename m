Most drivers do the sane thing:

     Disable interrupts at the device level
     Install handler via request_irq()
     Setup stuff
     Enable interrupts at the device level

So no, there is no way this is supposed to work with drivers which
don't follow that simple scheme.

commit 0e43785c5 (irq: use GFP_KERNEL for action allocation in
request_irq()) changed that particular instance to GFP_KERNEL because
the request_irq code calls (and always did) code which cannot be
called in atomic contexts, e.g. the proc entry handling.
