FWIW, from the POV of libvirt and its KVM/LXC drivers, I think that
co-mounting all controllers is just fine. In our usage model we
always want to have exactly the same hierarchy for all of them. It
rather complicates life to have to deal with multiple hierarchies,
so I'd be happy if they went away.

libvirtd will always create its own cgroups starting at the location
where libvirtd itself has been placed. This is to co-operate with
systemd / initscripts which may place each system service in a
dedicated group. Thus historically we usually end up in a layout:

 $CG_MOUNT_ROOT
  |
  +- apache.service
  +- mysql.service
  +- sendmail.service
  +- ....service
  +- libvirtd.service (if systemd has put us in an isolated group)
      |
      +- libvirt
          |
          +- lxc
          |   |
          |   +- container1
          |   +- container2
          |   +- container3
          |   ...
          +- qemu
              |
              +- machine1
              +- machine2
              +- machine3
              ...

Now we know that many controllers don't respect this hiearchy and
will flatten it so all those leaf nodes (container1, container2,
machine1, machine2...etc) are immediately at the root level. While
this is clearly sub-optimal, for our current needs that does not
actually harm us really. While we did intend that a sysadmin could
place controls on the 'libvirt', 'lxc' or 'qemu' cgroups, I'm not
aware of anyone who actually does this currently. Everyone, so far,
only cares about placing controls in individual virtual machines
and containers.

Thus given what we now know about the performance problems wrt
hierarchies we're planning to flatten that significantly to look
closer to this:

 $CG_MOUNT_ROOT
  |
  +- apache.service
  +- mysql.service
  +- sendmail.service
  +- ....service
  +- libvirtd.service (if systemd has put us in an isolated group)
      |
      +- libvirt-lxc-container1
      +- libvirt-lxc-container2
      +- libvirt-lxc-container3
      +- libvirt-lxc-...
      +- libvirt-qemu-machine1
      +- libvirt-qemu-machine2
      +- libvirt-qemu-machine3
      +- libvirt-qemu-...

(though we'll have config option to retain the old style hiearchy
too for backwards compatibility)

Also bear in mind that with containers, the processes inside
the containers may want to use cgroups too. eg if runnning
systemd inside a container too

 $CG_MOUNT_ROOT
  |
  +- apache.service
  +- mysql.service
  +- sendmail.service
  +- ....service
  +- libvirtd.service (if systemd has put us in an isolated group)
      |
      +- libvirt-lxc-container1
      |   |
      |   +- apache.service
      |   +- mysql.service
      |   +- sendmail.service
      |   ...
      +- libvirt-lxc-container2
      +- libvirt-lxc-container3
      +- libvirt-lxc-...
      +- libvirt-qemu-machine1
      +- libvirt-qemu-machine2
      +- libvirt-qemu-machine3
      +- libvirt-qemu-...

Or if each user login session has been given a cgroup and we are
running libvirtd as a non-root user, we can end up with something
like this:

 $CG_MOUNT_ROOT
  |
  +- fred.user
  +- joe.user
  +- bob.user
      |
      +- libvirtd.service (if systemd has put us in an isolated group)
          |
          +- libvirt-qemu-machine1
          +- libvirt-qemu-machine2
          +- libvirt-qemu-machine3
          +- libvirt-qemu-...

In essence what I'm saying is that I'm fine with co-mounting. What
we care about is being able to create the kind of hiearchies outlined
above, and have all controllers actually work sensibly with them.

The systemd & libvirt folks came up with the following recommendations
to try to get good co-operation between different user space apps who
want to use cgroups. Basically the idea is that if each app follows the
guidelines, then no individual app should need to have a global world
of all cgroups.

  http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PaxControlGroups

I think everything you describe is compatible with what we've documented
there.

Daniel
