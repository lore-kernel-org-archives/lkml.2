That's just plain broken and I'm very pleased to see you fix it.

I was just surprised that it was still broken and wondering how that 
happened.  Looking at ToT I see that because I dropped the ball in 2008, 
Jeff's patches didn't address the problem.  In ToT 
svc_pool_map_set_cpumask() is called *after* kthread_create() and 
applies to the child thread, *after* it's stack has been allocated on 
the wrong node.  In the working SGI code, svc_pool_map_set_cpumask() is 
called by the parent node on itself *before* calling kernel_thread() or 
doing any of the data structure allocations, thus ensuring that 
everything gets allocated using the default memory allocation policy, 
which on SGI NFS servers was globally tuned to be "node-local".

Ah, I see.  It's unfortunate that the kthread_create() API ends up being 
passed a CPU number but that's only used to format the name and not for 
sensible things :(
