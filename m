Because with the handler restore process looks very natural and simple - each
task does the following steps

1. restore task resources (open files, set IDs, restore connections, wire back timers, etc.)
2. call execve() to jump into new memory+registers context which is
   a. unmap all the user memory
   b. map required mappings
   c. populate them with data
   d. restore registers
   e. restore IP

Note, that steps a through e are what execve() is designed for from day 1. Also note,
that when talking about the binary handler I do not insist in having my own one - it's
perfectly fine with me if we can make the ELF handler do the job (and I'm going to investigate
this ability soon).

With SEIZE it looks worse (maybe I'm seeing it wrong, then correct me please):

1. restore task resources
2. freeze
3. some foreigner attaches a parasite to the frozen task and the parasite
   should do steps a through e from the previous list to restore mem+regs context,
   but when doing steps a and b it should care about not killing himself from the
   target task context

This SEIZE-d restoring looks very complex and not efficient to me.

Am I wrong at some point?
