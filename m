Hi Tomo and Co,

Just to clarify my position on your efforts here, as I do agree with
James that they deserve a reply, regardless of my personal thoughts..

My main problem was that I was not expecting a port of IET userspace to
lio-4.1 for the main -> default login control path, so it makes it very
difficult for me to consider this type of split when the userspace code
is AFAICT not aware of any dynamic changes to the iscsi-target control
plane in /sys/kernel/config/target/iscsi/, which makes it extremely
fragile in it's current state.

So that said, I would be willing to consider merging this type of code
as an EXPERIMENTAL feature into a lio-core-2.6.git working tree for you,
if:

*) It can be made completely optional, and the currently proposed v3.1
login path runs in-kernel as the default so that it can function
cooperatively in the same tree with my own 'optional to implement'
authentication efforts in LIO upstream.
*) You commit to producing a userspace daemon that is aware of dynamic
changes to the configfs layout by userspace driven within an individual
iscsi-target contexts.  I don't care if this is IET or LIO, but the
daemon cannot be static to configfs layout changes.
*) We consider the fully in-kernel approach with 10,000+ endpoint layout
configurations for the non authenticated (CSG=1) login path for the
large scale demo-mode public iscsi-target setups.

So with this we can both have what we want in LIO upstream working tree,
with little effect on the current in-kernel code proposed for v3.1.
This is what I care most about personally and am committing to support
for v3.1 and beyond, and must be absoulutely rock solid for all possible
dynamic configfs configuration changes.  This is the control plane
design that I believe has been presented in the v3.1-rc1 merge request.

Thanks,

--nab
