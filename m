Hmm, yes, we CAN do that, if user carefully sets the udev log-level
high, and saves udev log every boot or device change.

I think the main point of this attempt is to reduce the cost of
those operation, as like as users have done with old un*x way.

If we can use a same device name for same device and can see the
same name on the kernel log, we don't need to pay additional cost
for searching and picking correct entry from udev log.
Of course, it needs updates on some tools too.

BTW, I'm also interested in that structured error events, from the long
term view and viewpoint of tracers :)
I think we could expand current TRACE_EVENT macro to define those error
events.
