Wouldn't it be better if the root filesystem was marked as
non-removable in the device tree - or in the case of a truly removable
card, just marked in the MMC subsystem - and the MMC subsystem skipped
the "it could be removed" for suspend/resume operations?

Whether you can or you cannot remove an SD memory device or eMMC
controller, having an option that marked "DANGEROUS" that says "MMC
layer will assume that all cards stayed in their respective slots
during the suspend" implies that on a system such as the
numbering-more-than-I-can-count embedded devices here with eMMC and
any number greater than zero SD card slots (most of them having at
least two), ALL of them are treated as unsafe resume, when in fact
only one of them might be.

My use cases here are usually boot from eMMC or boot from external SD
card (Snowball, Efika MX but one SD card slot is usually not needed to
go through the unsafe-resume process, all FSL i.MX boards since MX51
Babbage through the new MX6 boards, Pandaboard, Beagleboard). Just
because it's possible to boot from external, removable SD card
shouldn't mean we all have to configure our kernels explicitly to go
through a strange and unusual path for suspend and resume which leaves
ALL cards 'mounted' unecessarily over suspend/resume, especially in
the common case where eMMC is also not the ONLY boot medium (PATA,
SATA, non-eMMC flash) and eMMC or SD *MAY* only be the root filesystem
(as opposed to *WILL*)
