Four days (for a 32-bit counter) is just not enough, so the counter
needs to be e.g. 64-bit as proposed.  A 64-bit counter won't wrap during
lifetime of a system.

The CPUs' timestamp counters were not designed for security.  I would
not be too surprised if some implementation of a CPU architecture (maybe
emulated, maybe under a hypervisor) has such timestamp counter
granularity that we may see the same value across a second execve().

Also, we'd need extra code for archs/CPUs that lack timestamp counters.

I'd rather not rely on the timestamp counters across CPUs being in sync,
and if they are not in sync then we may see the same value again (on one
CPU vs. another).  So at least we'd need to record the CPU number as well.

32 bits is just not enough even if not under control of an attacker.
If there's some low chance of hitting the same counter value on execve()
vs. procfs file access and there's no lockout on multiple counter
mismatches, an attacker may simply try that in a loop, and with 32-bit
values might have a good chance of succeeding in a reasonable amount of
time (such as a few days).
