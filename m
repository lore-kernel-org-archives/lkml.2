The best thread on the topic is this massive one:

http://marc.info/?t=120109820100005

I want replacement because evidence suggests that multiple things doing
the same thing don't get as much attention as a single one.  We need to
support STGT because it's the one that has the in-kernel user base.
Just breaking them constitutes an ABI problem under the new kernel
rules.

Yes, in that thread.

My basic conclusion was that there's no incredible discriminator between
LIO and STGT (although there are reams written on which performs better
in which circumsances, is useful for clustering, supports ALUA, etc.
each with partisans for the features).  If the two communities can't
work together (as seems to be the case) and I have to choose one, I'll
go by what helps me which, as I've said before, are:

     1. That it would be a drop in replacement for STGT (our current
        in-kernel target mode driver), since he only wanted a single
        SCSI target infrastructure. 
        
     2. That it used a modern sysfs based control and configuration
        plane. 
        
     3. That the code was reviewed as clean enough for inclusion.

Well, my preference would be to keep STGT.  However, I indicated to both
target infrastructures that if they could satisfy the above, I'd be OK
with replacing STGT, so I'm not about to go back on that after causing
quite a large amount of work.
