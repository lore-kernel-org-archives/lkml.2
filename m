OH COME ON!!!!

stgit helpfully changed the From lines, screwing everything up.  Awesome.  I
apologize, I wasn't expecting stgit to change the From: lines when I migrated
the disk format changes to the front of the set.

I don't really want to respam the list just to fix this one little thing.  If
people want more code changes I'll gladly make them and re-send.  If not, then
Ted, I can just send you the whole mess as a big mbox file, or post them on a
webserver somewhere, with correct attribution.
