I'm curious.  Why do you particularly care what interface the kernel uses to
provide you with access to this attribute?

And given that it is an attribute that is not part of 'POSIX' or "UNIX", it
would seem to be an extension - an extended attribute.
As the Linux kernel does virtually nothing with this attribute except provide
access, it seems to be a very different class of thing to other timestamps.
Surely it is simply some storage associated with a file which is capable of
storing a timestamp, which can be set or retrieved by an application, and
which happens to be initialised to the current time when a file is created.

Yes, to you it is a timestamp.  But to Linux it is a few bytes of
user-settable metadata.  Sounds like an EA to me.

Or do you really want something like BSD's 'btime' which as I understand it
cannot be set.  Would that be really useful to you?

Is there something important that I am missing?
