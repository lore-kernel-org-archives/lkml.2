Yes, we should default to off, and probably only enable it just right
before we start /sbin/init from the mounted root or in initramfs.
There should be no useful use of /sbin/hotplug before we mounted root,
or unpacked initramfs.

It is insane, and the entire uevent hookup with /sbin/hotplug should
just be removed. We send from 1000 to many 1000s of events at bootup,
and forking a binary here makes not much sense these days.

All distros default to CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER_PATH="" because nothing
else really works anymore, some boxes don't even boot up.
/sbin/hotplug worked fine when we all had one USB mouse connected and
needed to load like 5 drivers for the system, but not today.

It's a broken concept today, at least in the way we plug it into the
driver core makes no sense today, it is just a heritage from the old
days.
