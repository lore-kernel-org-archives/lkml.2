  Hmm, so I was looking at this and I think there are following locking
constrants (please correct me if I have something wrong):
iolock -> trans start (per your claim above)
trans start -> ilock (ditto)
iolock -> mmap_sem (aio write holds iolock and copying data from userspace
  might need mmap sem if it hits page fault)
mmap_sem -> ilock (do_wp_page -> block_page_mkwrite -> __xfs_get_blocks)
freezing -> trans start (so that we can clean the filesystem during
              freezing)

So I see two choices here.
  1) Put 'freezing' above iolock as you suggest. But then handling the page
fault path becomes challenging. We cannot block there easily because we are
called with mmap_sem held. I just talked with Mel and it seems that
dropping mmap_sem in ->page_mkwrite(), blocking, retaking mmap_sem and
returning VM_FAULT_RETRY might work but we'll see whether some other mm guy
won't kill me for that ;).
  2) Put 'freezing' below mmap_sem. That would put it below iolock/i_mutex
as well. Then handling page fault is easy. We could not block in ->aio_write
but we'd have to block in ->write_begin() instead. Similarly we would have
to block in other write paths.

The first approach has the advantage that we could put lots of frozen
checks into VFS thus making them shared among filesystems (possibly even
making freezing reliable for filesystems such as ext2). The second approach
is simpler as we could do most of the freezing checks while we start a
transaction at least for filesystems that have transactions... Any
preferences?
