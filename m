Yep.

ok.

You're absolutely right, this should not be a limitation in the code.

The only callers of the yield method are yielding to a kernel thread
that is always going to exist.  I didn't see a need to add any
complexity here for a case that doesn't yet exist.

No, see above.

Sorry for confusing you.  Your deduction is correct.  Is there a way I
can write this that would be less confusing to you?

Yes, thanks again.

yield_to is not a flag.  ;-)  It is not cleared as it is only valid if
the cfq_cfqq_yield flag is set.  If you would find it more sensible, I
can certainly add code to clear it.

I'll give that a shot, thanks for the suggestion.  My concern is that,
when employing cgroups, you may never actually yield the queue depending
on where the file system's journal thread ends up.
