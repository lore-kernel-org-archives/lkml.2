Because THP charges 2M bytes at once, the optimization by 'stock' will have no
effects. (It merges 512page faults into a page fault.)
I think you can't see any performance difference even if we handle THP
pages with 'stock'.

And I think MAX_CHARGE_BATCH=1024 is too big...If you have 256cpus, you'll
have 1GB of cached charges...it means 1GB of inaccuracy of usage.
If you want to enlarge it, please show performance benefit.
