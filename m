FWIW, I looked at most of the places in the kernel that do
TASK_KILLABLE sleeps and they look like they'll handle this correctly.
The main one I wasn't sure about was mem_cgroup_handle_oom(), but I
think it'll do the right thing too. I certainly could have missed
something though...

In any case, would you mind merging this via the linux-pm tree for 3.2?
