On second thought...getting rid of the ctor function here might be
problematic. We have to call inode_init_once, etc...

Almost all of the inode slabs have one, so I've settled for just moving
the INIT_DELAYED_WORK call out of init_once and into rpc_alloc_inode. I
sent a patch to Trond and linux-nfs to do that. That will fix this
case, but I do wonder if there are other places in the kernel that have
similar problems with debugobject initialization.
