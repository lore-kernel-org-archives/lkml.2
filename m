Ugh, I see the problem: I thought svc_export_request was called at the
time mountd does the read, but instead its done at the time nfsd does
the upcall.

I suspect that's wrong, and we really want this done in the context of
the mountd process when it does the read call.  If d_path is called
there then we have no problem.
