Because it pushes the tradeoff in the right direction.  Somebody wants
to do something weird is a little inconvenienced vs protecting the vast
majority of users from some security escalation problems.

Besides, if you have a real bus with discoverable regions
(like PCI BARs), the bus should have sysfs entries like
/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:06\:06.0/resource0 that can be mmaped.
Then there's no need for a device driver at all, *and* the privilege
escalation isn't achievable.

Of course, most embedded architectures have crap discoverability.
