  Sorry, but this is just wrong. Not only because of inode_lock as
Christoph pointed out but mainly principially. ext4 and ocfs2 in
data=ordered mode rely on data pages (with underlying blocks already
allocated) being written out before transaction commit proceeds for data
integrity. So you cannot just go and remove the writeback saying it
improves performance.

I'm not saying that ext4 handling of ordered mode does not need a revision
(we actually talked with Ted about it at Kernel Summit). But the solution
for it is to use IO completion callback to do extent tree manipulations
and stop using JBD2 for data syncing. We already do that for direct IO and
conversion of preallocated space so doing it in all cases should be
reasonably easy. Until that happens, you can run ext4 in data=writeback
mode which will also stop JBD2 from doing the writeback (and effectively is
rather similar to your patch).
