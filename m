I don't think it can be intended to cause 'execve' to fail when a user is at
the NPROC limit - except in the specific case that the process has previously
called setuid.  So I feel justified in calling it an unintended consequence.
It my not be a very common consequence but but we all know that uncommon
things do happen.

I agree that having different limits for different cases could make this much
less of a problem, but it doesn't necessarily remove it.

Yes, the PF_FORKNOEXEC test causes problems in that case.

Using just the PF_SUPERPRIV test would still be a good idea I think, but would
not be quite as thorough a check.
Adding a new PF flag would be possible (there seem to be 3 unused) but is
probably not justified.
