Ok, thanks for explanation.
I've sent rebased "v2" of the patch set, contains updated patch "SUNRPC: handle 
RPC client pipefs dentries by network namespace aware routine", which, I 
believe, fixes oops, spotted by Bryan (it was caused by excessive call of 
rpc_put_mount() on PipeFS dentries unlink).
So, if I'm not mistaken here, there's no need in implementing of dummy versions 
of rpc_pipefs_notifier_(un)register() or any other dummy stuff.

BTW, it looks like that in last 2 days I've sent all updates to the issues you 
pointed out. If not, please, ping me once more.
