Colin, what became of this patch?  I see this in your Tegra tree for
Android.

http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=kernel/tegra.git;a=commit;h=05946a1e0fdb011ac0e6638ee60b181c584f127b

I looked in linux-next but didn't see it there.  This resolves a
performance issue on MSM SMP so I'm curious if this is going upstream.
 Thanks.
