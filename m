so back in the time that worked on a project that used Qt as their 
toolkit (geez is it that long ago already ;-) )... we fixed Qt to stop 
doing this.
The right level for this sort of thing is the toolkit level (which by 
and large also does the animations), not Xlib.
The toolkit level also will then need to provide the right notifications 
to the app for things the toolkit does not do
(eg "we're at least partially visible" versus "now none of our pixels 
are on the screen").

It ended up being a thing for the toolkit and a minor tweak in the 
compositor... and it worked quite ok, the app guys actually
asked for the API (because they knew I would beat them up for getting it 
wrong)...

doing things on the xlib level (or even X level) means you take away the 
chance for the App(tm) to do things the right way;
make it easy for the app, not hard.
