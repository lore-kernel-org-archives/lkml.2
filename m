What I was trying to say here is we currently have a consistent
userspace library for the two default iscsi-target cases that is
completely driven by python userspace code.  We use rtslib to mask the
possible future changes (and breakage) to the target kernel api
(configfs) to avoid direct breakage with apps using the library, as well
as being able to gracefully add new API functionality using the
modern /var/target/spec/ layout that thus far has been fully native
using /sys/kernel/config/target/ (eg: no external userspace C code)

Yes, we do expect to have to change rtslib as neccessary in order to
support new features including the optional to implement fabric
dependent authentication methods.  How that looks is larely dependent on
the interaction with configfs, and what extra userspace daemons need to
be involved.  What I am very eager to avoid is more userspace dependence
for the default login cases that everyone will be using for v3.1.

Yes, but the specific discussion for 'optional to implement' is low on
the priority list now as we don't have iSCSI clients that use it for
v3.1.  So I am very happy to move forward for v3.2 and start adding
these as necessary, and would even consider reviving the old
AuthMethod=SRP code for LIO-Target 2.x if folks are willing to help on
the open-iscsi side to make this happen.

But aside from this particular bit of code, the main concern here has
really been the discussion to move the default non authenticated paths
from the kernel and into single threaded userspace code, when the
current /sys/kernel/config/target/iscsi/ is capable of configuring
10,000+ endpoints individually.  This point I am very firm on from
having to develop a fully dynamic control plane over the years with out
of tree and pre configfs LIO-Target code, and is what I think what makes
the most sense technically moving forward with v4.1 iscsi-target code.

Thanks,
