Thanks for the cc.  After looking at the user namespace issues it looks
like the sane thing is really to map the user namespace uids into
appropriate uids for storing on the filesystem.  Anything else
seems to be a lot of pain for very little gain.

If a filesystem went as far as storing string ids.  I think I would
be happy to use different domains for different user namespaces, but
for anything else I just don't see the point.

What it does look like to me is that at some point we will want to
support > 32bit uids.  There are 7 billion people on the planet and we
only have 4 billion user ids.  The biggest individual organization have
3 million users, which keeps us safe for now.  However my forecast is
each user namespace is going to wind up giving each user a bunch of
uids.  That will accelerate the point at which we find 32bit uids tight.
How fast being generous and assigning 10k uids per user is going to get
us into trouble I don't know.
