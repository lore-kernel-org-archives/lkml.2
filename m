Um, so in a hashing algorithm that maps f:Z_m -> Z_n you can never
guarantee error detection if m>n because of hash collisions.  All you
can guarantee is that if f(a) != f(b) then a != b, so crc16 wouldn't be
able to *guarantee* error detection in anything over 2 bytes.

All of the rest of the magic in hashing functions goes into making sure
that the collision sets don't include common errors (like bit flipping).
In theory, for the correct polynomial, CRC-16 should be able to detect
single, double and triple bit flip errors in blocks of up to 8191
bytes ... of course, if those aren't your common errors, then this
analysis is useless ...
