Per-bdi interval/time tunables, if there comes such a need, will in
essential be for data caching and safety. If turning them into some
requirement for better performance, the users will potential be
stretched on choosing the "right" value for balanced data cache,
safety and performance.  Hmm, not a comfortable prospection.

The NFS write queue, on the other hand, is directly aimed for
improving NFS performance, latency and responsiveness.

In comparison to the per-bdi interval/time, it's more a guarantee of
smoother NFS writes.  As the tests show in the original email, with
the cost of a little more commits, it gains much better write
throughput and latency.

The NFS write queue is even a requirement, if we want to get
reasonable good responsiveness. Without it, the 20% dirty limit may
well be filled by NFS writeback/unstable pages. This is very bad for
responsiveness. Let me quote contents of two old emails (with small
fixes):

: PG_writeback pages have been the biggest source of
: latency issues in the various parts of the system.
: 
: It's not uncommon for me to see filesystems sleep on PG_writeback
: pages during heavy writeback, within some lock or transaction, which in
: turn stall many tasks that try to do IO or merely dirty some page in
: memory. Random writes are especially susceptible to such stalls. The
: stable page feature also vastly increase the chances of stalls by
: locking the writeback pages.
 
: When there are N seconds worth of writeback pages, it may
: take N/2 seconds on average for wait_on_page_writeback() to finish.
: So the total time cost of running into a random writeback page and
: waiting on it is also O(n^2):

:       E(PG_writeback waits) = P(hit PG_writeback) * E(wait on it)

: That means we can hardly keep more than 1-second worth of writeback
: pages w/o worrying about long waits on PG_writeback in various parts
: of the kernel.

: Page reclaim may also block on PG_writeback and/or PG_dirty pages. In
: the case of direct reclaim, it means blocking random tasks that are
: allocating memory in the system.
: 
: PG_writeback pages are much worse than PG_dirty pages in that they are
: not movable. This makes a big difference for high-order page allocations.
: To make room for a 2MB huge page, vmscan has the option to migrate
: PG_dirty pages, but for PG_writeback it has no better choices than to
: wait for IO completion.
: 
: The difficulty of THP allocation goes up *exponentially* with the
: number of PG_writeback pages. Assume PG_writeback pages are randomly
: distributed in the physical memory space. Then we have formula
: 
:         P(reclaimable for THP) = P(non-PG_writeback)^512
: 
: That's the possibly for a contiguous range of 512 pages to be free of
: PG_writeback, so that it's immediately reclaimable for use by
: transparent huge page. This ruby script shows us the concrete numbers.
: 
: irb> 1.upto(10) { |i| j=i/1000.0; printf "%.3f\t\t\t%.3f\n", j, (1-j)**512 }
: 
:         P(hit PG_writeback)     P(reclaimable for THP)
:         0.001                   0.599

: The numbers show that when the PG_writeback pages go up from 0.1% to
: 1% of system memory, the THP reclaim success ratio drops quickly from
: 60% to 0.6%. It indicates that in order to use THP without constantly
: running into stalls, the reasonable PG_writeback ratio is <= 0.1%.
: Going beyond that threshold, it quickly becomes intolerable.
: 
: That makes a limit of 256MB writeback pages for a mem=256GB system.
: Looking at the real vmstat:nr_writeback numbers in dd write tests:
: 
: JBOD-12SSD-thresh=8G/ext4-1dd-1-3.3.0/vmstat-end:nr_writeback 217009
: JBOD-12SSD-thresh=8G/ext4-10dd-1-3.3.0/vmstat-end:nr_writeback 198335
: JBOD-12SSD-thresh=8G/xfs-1dd-1-3.3.0/vmstat-end:nr_writeback 306026
: JBOD-12SSD-thresh=8G/xfs-10dd-1-3.3.0/vmstat-end:nr_writeback 315099
: JBOD-12SSD-thresh=8G/btrfs-1dd-1-3.3.0/vmstat-end:nr_writeback 1216058
: JBOD-12SSD-thresh=8G/btrfs-10dd-1-3.3.0/vmstat-end:nr_writeback 895335
: 
: Oops btrfs has 4GB writeback pages -- which asks for some bug fixing.
: Even ext4's 800MB still looks way too high, but that's ~1s worth of
: data per queue (or 130ms worth of data for the high performance Intel
: SSD, which is perhaps in danger of queue underruns?). So this system
: would require 512GB memory to comfortably run KVM instances with THP
: support.

The main concern on the NFS write wait queue, however, was that it
might hurt performance for long fat network pipes with large
bandwidth-delay products. If the pipe size can be properly estimated,
we'll be able to set adequate queue size and remove the last obstacle
of that patch.

Thanks,
