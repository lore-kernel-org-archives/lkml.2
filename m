OK, so the problem is that we might return a path to the file mapped
even if the directory which consists the former file has its permission
changed, right? For example, lets say we have

| lr-x------ 1 cyrill cyrill 64 Sep 14 19:35 /proc/self/map_files/3d73a00000-3d73a1c000 -> /lib64/ld-2.5.so

and once /lib64 became unreadable we should not return the path to
3d73a00000-3d73a1c000 as well, that is what you mean, right?
