Do we have a VFS tree right now?

Apparently some review was missed--do you have pointers to it, if
there's anything that isn't covered below?

Sounds reasonable.

Just to make sure I understand: you're just talking about the
implementation here--you want as much as possible to be done by routines
shared by NFSv4 and Posix ACLs--right?  (You're not suggesting that e.g.
a user should be able to treat NFSv4 ACLs as if they were Posix ACLs.)

It's the ACL model that Samba and NFSv4 clients use, and we want to do a
better job of exporting linux filesystems to those clients.

I don't know how to make the justification much longer than that.
