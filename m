Thanks!!  I've been trying to track down this bug for a while.  The
repro case I had ran the 12 fio's against 12 different file systems
with the following configuration:

[global]
direct=1
ioengine=libaio
iodepth=1
bs=4k
ba=4k
size=128m

[create]
filename=${TESTDIR}
rw=write

... and would leave a few inodes with elevated i_ioend_counts, which
means any attempt to delete those inodes or to unmount the file system
owning those inodes would hang forever.

With your patch this problem goes away.

Looks good to me.  Thanks, applied.

No, thank *you*!  :-)

P.S.  It would be nice to get this into xfstests, but it requires at
least 10-12 (12 to repro it reliably) HDD's, and a fairly high core
count machine in order to reproduce it.  I played around with trying
to create a reproducer that worked on a smaller number of disks and/or
fio's/CPU's, but I was never able to manage it.
