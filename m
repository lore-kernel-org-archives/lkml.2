Hi Darrick,

Just curious why we would need to have batching in both places? Doesn't your 
patch set make the jbd2 transaction batching redundant?

I noticed that the patches have a default delay and a mount option to override 
that default. The jbd2 code today tries to measure the average time needed in a 
transaction and automatically tune itself. Can't we do something similar with 
your patch set? (I hate to see yet another mount option added!)

Regards,

Ric
