Then we're requiring each transformation layer to have their own crcs,
and if the higher layers have a stronger crc (or other checks), there's
no path to ask the lower layers for other copies.

Here's a concrete example.  In each metadata block, btrfs stores the
fsid and the transid of the transaction that created it.  In the case of
a missed write, we'll read a perfect block from the lower layers.  Any
crcs will be correct and it'll pass through dm-crypt with flying colors.

But, it won't be the right block.  Btrfs will notice this and EIO.  In
the current ask-for-another-mirror config we'll go down and grab the
other copy.

In the stacked validation function model, dm-crypt replaces our
verification functions with something that operates on the encrypted
data, and it won't be able to detect the error or kick down to the
underlying raid1 for another copy.
