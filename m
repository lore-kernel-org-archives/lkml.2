I think the difference between what Linus says and what he actually
means in the above video could be easily misinterpreted, well especially
for some non-english speaking folks.  But I am certainly glad to see
that a russian translation is also available for this google git talk
for those who really want try to understand his reasons (and technical
requirements) for what he is saying.

So as to the specifics about why git is really the only right SCM choice
for mainline target mode maintainership, it really all comes down to
workflow.  Does your SCM allow other people to easily and without-pain
track your upstream subsystem tree changes and 'rebase' as necessary for
their patch series you make improvements..?   If we are talking about
say, a single standalone driver being developed against mainline, then
sure using a SCM like CVS or SVN is perfectly acceptable when you push
to someone upstream like gregkh or akpm via email patch attachments.

However, if we are talking about a subsystem maintainer workflow that
requires many different people to track your subsystem tree for their
own drivers and new feature bits, not being able to keep local branches
for these level developers makes their life excruciatingly painful and
unpleasent as they attempt to pull new upstream changes, especially when
the speed of new upstream development is moving quickly.  This rule
applys even more when said subsystem has a greater scope within the
source tree in question.

Anyways, if we are going to compare SCM distributed vs. centralized
workflow in terms of kernel projects, lets please at least compare
apples to apples here.

Best,
