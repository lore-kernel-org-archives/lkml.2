Yes, I was wondering quite how we would define this ->freepage thing,
if it gets called from one place that removes from page cache and not
from others.

Another minor problem with it: it would probably need to take the
struct address_space *mapping as arg as well as struct page *page:
because by this time page->mapping has been reset to NULL.

But I'm not at all keen on adding a calllback in this very special
frozen-to-0-references place: please let's not do it without an okay
from Nick Piggin (now Cc'ed).

I agree completely with what Linus said originally about how the
page cannot be freed while there's a reference to it, and it should
be possible to work this without your additional page locks.

Your ->releasepage should be able to judge whether the page is likely
(not certain) to be freed - page_count 3? 1 for the page cache, 1 for
the page_private reference, 1 for vmscan's reference, I think.  Then
it can mark !PageUptodate and proceed with freeing the stuff you had
allocated, undo page_has_private and its reference, and return 1 (or
return 0 if it decides to hold on to the page).

If something races in and grabs another reference to prevent removal
from page cache and freeing, then won't read_cache_page(), seeing
!Uptodate, do the right thing and set up the required info again?

Or perhaps I haven't looked far enough, and you do have races which
actually need your page locks, I can see they make it easier to think
about.

But I'd prefer us not to throw in another callback if it's well
workable with the ->releasepage we already have.  (If it helps,
perhaps we could adjust shrink_page_list() to allow for the page
being removed from page cache inside try_to_release_page() - but
I don't think that should be necessary.)
