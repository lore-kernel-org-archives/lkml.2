Eeeek... this seems to be an architecture specific bug that is only present
on s390.
The dirty bit for user space pages on all architectures but s390 are stored
into the PTE's. On s390 however they are stored into the storage key that
exists per _physical_ page.
So, what we should have done, when implementing suspend/resume on s390, is
to save the storage key for each page and write that to the suspend device
and upon resume restore the storage key contents for each physical page.
The code that would do that is missing... Hence _all_ pages of the resumed
image are dirty after they have been copied to their location.
*ouch*

Will fix.
